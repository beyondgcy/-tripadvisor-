We wanted a pool, bar and the ability to cook ‘at home’ sometimes so we could avoid paying through the nose for fast food and the like in the theme parks and to be able to relax and suit ourselves.We chose the right place. The 3 bedroom apartment (we were on the top floor of block 8) was clean, well maintained and very spacious for our family of 5.The location was around 10-15 minutes to the Animal Kingdom and a bit longer to get to the other Disney Parks. We drove around 25-30 minutes to the nearest shopping outlets too. The main road to the parks is a busy road and you may sit in traffic at peak times. We didn’t mind this as we didn’t have any appointments or set times we wanted to be at the parks for. It also can’t be helped.The bar was great and offered reasonably priced drinks and great cocktails (Mudslide was delightful). Marissa was lovely and we chatted to her about her life in Florida.The staff were very helpful when our cards kept cancelling out because of me keeping them next to my mobile phone or other cards (my fault). I requested extra towels but these didn’t materialise so I took some clean ones from the pool instead. I did get some help printing a voucher from email for park tickets too. WiFi is fantastic.The pool was great for the kids and they loved the hot tub too.We were happy with the price we paid and the amenities provided. We enjoyed our night at the karaoke although we didn’t get up and sing!We’ll be back next year. :-)",2018/11/08,2018/10/01,Traveled with family,1  ,,,,1,2,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niclouc80,9,4,,,11,24,22,,14,8,1,1,0,0,0,35,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",2015/05/01, 2752 ,22,2019/01/02

What won’t change is the traffic in this area. It’s terrible! If you enjoy sitting in horrible traffic everyday of your vacation then stay here. This exit off of I-4 is always backed up for miles going east and west at all times of the day. It gets so backed up that you can’t drive on Champions Gate Blvd due to the solid line of cars trying to get on I-4. Many mornings we would have to wait 2 or 3 cycles of the light just to pull onto Champions Gate Blvd on our way to the theme parks and then would sit on I-4 for an hour or more. Traffic is so frustrating in this area, that you couldn’t give me a unit in this resort.Okay, now back to the room. Our room was okay. The furnishings were a bit worn but they were functional. The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare meals. Our biggest complaint about the physical room was that the sink drains were all clogged making the sinks unusable. The showers drained slowly as well. As far as the location of our room, it couldn’t have been worse for noise. The neighbor below us kept their yipping Yorkie trapped on their porch for hours every day and night. The dang dog yipped, whined and barked at everything. I literally hated that dog and more importantly it’s owners by the time we left. We knocked on their door several times to ask them nicely to bring their dog in and they didn’t answer. The neighbor above us had lead shoes and clearly must enjoy moving large pieces of furniture around their apartment all day and night long. From 5:30am some days until 1:30 am we listened to the constant booming from the ceiling above. Our building was also located right along I-4 so we listened to the cars and trucks as they slogged along at 4-5 mph blowing their horns. The walls and ceilings are thin so don’t plan on ever getting a good nights sleep.The pool was nice. You can walk to a few restaurants and bars. Publix grocery is close by. I personally, will never stay here or anywhere off this exit again.",2018/12/29,2018/12/01,Traveled with family,,,,,0,0,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JetBlueDriver,188,6,man,35-49,474,787,238,Foodie,453,177,128,25,4,0,1,1264,"Charlotte, North Carolina",2009/01/01, 93168 ,135,2019/01/02

We tried to stop by the office the next morning but there was a line a mile long and we had a tournament to get to. Also, the sheets were scratchy and felt like cardboard. Be warned.....it is very dark when driving to this building and there is a big pothole in the middle of the road which they simply marked with an orange cone.

We were very disappointed with our stay. The units are big and can fit up to 6 people comfortably. The unit was filthy. First day we checked in we had to spend hours just cleaning the unit. The floor was sticky and made your feet black. The sheets had hair and looked dirty. Dishes were put away dirty and the showers had hair and whatever else in them. You should not have to spend money on a dirty unit. The furniture in the unit was really bad. Couch is so small and really dirty, dining table chairs have stains and crusty food on them. No pot holders, soap, toilet paper, garbage bags, paper towel, etc. we had to go buy everything. We didn’t have enough towels for 4 people. We went and complained and they said they were sending a vip service (which never came). We went down to see why they never came and we just got excuses. We got our cleaning fee back but that didn’t even cover the stuff we bought to clean the unit. I will not stay here again. That’s sad because it’s in an awesome location to visit our family and friends. On a positive note the pool is nice and we liked having a washer and dryer in the unit so we didn’t have to pack as much. Plus we had enough space for us not to be on top of one another. Our kids are 6 and 9 for those of you families traveling with kids. In champions gate area the locals will tell you to go for a vacation rental home. There are tons in the area. The pictures for Tuscana are not right on their site. No barstools or fancy leather couches. The beds are very wore and make your body ache. No extra blankets, pillows or sheets. The people above our unit were awake 24/7 and pretty loud. Banging even at 3am. So little kids and babies would never be able to sleep. Sad to say we will not be back here on our future trips. So much more was wrong but these were the major things. We never ate on site so I can’t review on the restaurants at tuscana. The pool bar was ok but no one ever came out from behind the bar.

Davenport is very well located, has all kind of restaurants and supermarkets (Publix, Wallgreens, 7Eleven) for your convenience.

Apparently it's okay for them to do it until 1am (according to the security guard) so if you find yourself with no choice but to stay here then my tip is to make sure you're not in building number 1. This seems to happen on Thursday and Saturday, but at least on the last Thursday it stopped by 11pm. To make matters worse, after been kept up by the 'music' we were then woken up the next morning at 7am by one of the cleaning staff sat in her car with the stereo on full blast and the doors open. Zero regard for the guests. Next one is to make sure, if you're on the ground floor, that your master bedroom does not overlook the air con units, another thing that will keep you up. The buildings are pretty poorly built and you'll hear every footstep if you've got someone in the room above. Watch out for the cleaning staff in their golf buggy hooning around the carpark. Apart from that it really comes down to maintenance, the TV was hanging off the wall, kitchen is hit and miss as to what cutlery you'll have, overall the apartments just feel 'tired'. The staff are hit and miss, some rude, some just okay. Keycards seemed to stop working every other day meaning a trip to the lovely reception. Extra resort charge not explained at check-in (seemed like having to check people into their rooms was not what the girl on reception really wants to be doing with her life). Tuscana will likely respond that is on the website, but it should still be explained at check-in. In fairness to the morning staff, we did get moved to a new room after telling them about some of the issues with the room. Unfortunately that's how we ended up at the disco. One good thing, the WiFi. Had excellent service throughout our stay with high speeds. As we only used the pool twice and no other facilities the WiFi effectively cost $15 per day because of the resort fee so it's a good job it worked so well. We've been to Orlando many times now and one thing it offers is plenty of choice of places to stay so we will be looking elsewhere in the future (will also be avoiding Thomas Cook who recommend the place). Finally, whilst this is close to Disney you are South of everything and you only really have the I4 as an option. This is basically a crawl or standstill when you need to get to the parks in the morning or get home at night. Obviously not the fault of the resort, just worth mentioning.

Beers were half price but what wasn't explained on the notice board is that it was only a select number of beers &amp; not the more popular ones, they also served the beer in smaller glasses during happy hour but were still charging half price of the larger beers, I did challenge them about both issues &amp; was told thats the way it is, poor customer service, however I must point out that the notice on the board was changed the following day to selected beers half price so at least one message got through. We also found that the language from the younger bar staff late in the evening was to say the least colourful &amp; we were more than slightly embarrassed sitting there having a drink listing to this so we decided to go to one of the bars up the road after a couple of nights of this carry on.Overall we did find the Tuscana was well looked after, clean within walking distance of a number of shops, bars &amp; restaurants &amp; about a 30-40 minute drive from most of the parks so a good place to be based ",2018/09/18,2018/06/01,,,,,,0,0,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/padraigr,39,5,man,35-49,21,41,31,Family Vacationer,22,13,2,2,2,0,0,135,"Dublin, Ireland",2008/08/01, 6246 ,29,2019/01/02

We were on the 4th floor and the lift call button didn’t work so we had to either walk down or get the lift from 3, not a problem for us but not good if you weren’t fully able.The bar and pool are ok, the jacuzzi was filthy with scum floating on top so avoided that one and at one point another resident allowed their dog to swim in the pool, they were asked to stop it but only after it had done several laps of the pool! The food in the restaurant was basic and overpriced - I’d advise going off resort and visiting Chillis.Now the real kicker - on arrival read the contract you are signing! Tuscana charge $19 per day “facilities” , $60 cleaning at end of stay and $39 insurance, this adds $370 to a two week stay - tuscana claims the travel agents are told in advance, I wasn’t so you get a nasty surprise on arrival because they won’t let you stay unless you sign and the staff on reception are careful not to point the charges out to you! - reading other reviews this has caught others out too.Overall if I’d know about the extra $370 before arriving i’d Have booked somewhere else because it’s not value for your money in my opinion.",2018/08/28,2018/07/01,Traveled with family,3  ,,,,0,0,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brianrY4662QH,1,,,,,1,3,,,,,,,0,0,1,,2018/08/01, 103 ,4,2019/01/02

Do not expect high luxury. This is a family-friendly (and pet-friendly) resort with comforts that feel like home ... meaning not perfection. Examples: some cracked sockets, broken/missing fixtures, or crooked cabinet doors. But the freedom to bring our dog, hang out on a balcony, enjoy a full kitchen, and laze out by the pool were all nice low-maintenance benefits. No room service, shuttle service (to the theme parks), or major concierge service, but you get to be yourself without all that worry. Summary, be prepared that your room might not be ""all that"", but just relax and enjoy the comforts of home (with maybe some noise from your upstairs neighbors).

Three times on three days I asked and was told the same answer. Many of the weights have huge chips out them too and the leather on the benches are ripped up.The internet and TV service then breaks down and the reception claims it’s for five miles around the area. Well, the internet in all the local bars and shops works fine and they’re within half a mile. They’re unable to give an indication on when it’ll be sorted and blame everyone else bar themselves. Then there is the bar! I can’t think of a poorer experience and I’ve drank in many spit and sawdust joints.The barmaid ignores guests while she focuses on residents. So much that she has conversations for at least 5 minutes before serving guests. The drink prices change daily. One night a pint of draught was $6, then $3.50 and then $5.80. Each time the draught beer was the same make and size.The residents mil round the bar making it difficult to get served and the barmaid (who is also the franchisee for the bar) ignores the fact people are struggling to get past ignorant residents.The beer is flat where you will find more gas in still water.The vacuum cleaner in the room was broken when we arrived. After two weeks it was not replaced or repaired despite flagging this up.When taking rubbish down, you have to walk 100 yards to a fly infested tip.

The side of the microwave was cracked in half and taped back together. Their was damage to the tiles around the bath tub and the room wreaked of cigarette smoke. I called the front desk to ask to change rooms and they would not let me since I booked through a travel company and that I had to come and speak to the manager the next morning. We were seriously grossed out, but was so late we decided to try to clean room up on our own. Went to use the vacuum cleaner that came with the unit and apparently it had been damaged and someone fixed with a syringe that was sticking out of the side of it. The next morning I went to the front desk and they allowed us to switch rooms which was a vast improvement, but still not completely cleaned, and gave us a refund on our resort fee. We would have left had our whole soccer team not be staying at the same resort and checking in that day. We went to the store, bought cleaning supplies and cleaned the room.

Ours was a 2 bedroom with kitchen and dining table. The unit we stayed at was clean and comfortable and we didn't hear too much noise from other units. Resort has a nice big pool and hot tub although it was a little chilly for swimming the week we were there. Staff was polite and helpful. About the only negative I could see with this resort was some of the people staying there were regularly leaving there garbage all over the place which attracted the local raccoon population.

The second issue was a barking dog in the apartment below us, this again disturbed our sleep early in the morning and once during the night. I understand you have a pet friendly policy but you should advise visitors of this on arrival if there are pets in the block. I wouldn’t be surprised if other people complain about this. The final issue was a piece of metal sticking out from one of beds which my husband cut his leg on. When we mentioned all of the above to reception we were advised that you would give us a discount for our next stay. We are not likely to return due to the issues we experienced which is a shame as it’s a great location, has lovely grounds and very nice pool area. I hope you take on board my comments and have fixed the bed so that a child does not get harmed......",2018/06/19,2018/06/01,Traveled with family,1  ,,,,0,0,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jubey73,1,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,0,0,1,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",2018/06/01, 101 ,4,2019/01/02

There aren't a lot of other amenities in the resort, golf and a gym. However, this isn't a problem as most people are there to visit the parks which take the day.

When all you want to do is relax there is no going back to the room to cook you can get a great meal onsite. Dave the owner has a great personality as did his staff. My negatives are the condos ""can"" be worn and out of date. You are at the mercy of the owner of the unit as to whether the place truly feels vacation worthy. I started my 3 week stay with having to spot clean a filthy worn stained carpet. The general cleaning was good but only so much could be done with the old carpet and furniture. I paid a lot of money. Some of the buildings border I-4 and forget sitting on your balcony if you want tranquility. This being said I will return and have been promised a much better unit next Feb. It is worth a stay with all businesses within walking distance. Thank you Jenny, the manager, for trying to take care of issues out of your control.

I decided to go to Orlando. At the time it was freezing in Atlanta and it was continuously raining on and off in Fl. with unseasonably ""cold"" weather. When the weather broke for a few days, I decided to head to Davenport, which is like 5-7 Interstate Miles from Disney. I think Disney is like exit # 62-67, Davenport is exit number #58, I believe. Tuscana is immediately off the exit, no 10 mile drive to the resort. It is surrounded by Publix, lots of food choices, stores, and near the interstate. It was great pick. It has a contemporary spanish feel, upon arriving. The grounds is very nice. My only complaint would be that the Owners of the Condos, should update their furniture and appliances more often. I personally don't want to see a white substance on the cloth furniture on the living room sofa. Other than that, the layout of the condo was great. Sep. Dining Area, Living Area, Screened patio, Ensuite Bedrooms or Bedrooms easily accessible to the bath. I walked to the pool daily and enjoyed the cabannas. The Bartender was great. The second thing that I didn't like was the wild squirrels. I wanted to lay under the cabana and eat and drink my food, however the squirrels were on ""10""! They would run up to you, jump on the curtains behind your head, crawl up the chair that you were relaxing on. I didn't like that, but other than those couple of snafus....I think its a great place to relax. I didn't see many kids, just a couple. I also saw over 30years and older just relaxing. To me, I would definitely stay again.

At the Reception desk, you could find the same lady from the night before with an attitude, not wanting to help and making you feel like you are annoying her. I observed the cleaning personnel driving the golf cart around the resort like they were in the Turnpike, if they are the ones who cleaned our room, I have no doubt they did their job the same way they drove the golf carts. This places is a run down so called resort. My recommendation is STAY AWAY! By the way bring all your toiletries, they provide a tiny soap that has been stores for years since it never dissolved ☹️.

I had been in touch with Reservations some weeks before arriving and everything we had asked was fulfilled 100% we even got upgraded to a huge 3 Bedroom Apartment which was fine. There were a few little niggles like a slow clogged shower it was also just about on its last legs, there was a few cupboard doors that were broken the dishwasher was no use to man nor beast and the balcony was veiwless!!!! Just trees lots of trees. The bedding really needs upgrades and the bedspreads had not been cleaned!!!! Ours stank of someone's B.O!!! And we removed it for the whole time we were there. Our door lock stopped working 2 times. We didn't complain about anything as it was all stuff that didn't matter in the grand scheme of things BUT!!!!! We had an awesome time there!!!! THE BEST BIT WAS......THE POOL!!!! Amazing amazing amazing the temperature was perfect the cabanas were great the pool Bar awesome too!!!! The hot tub was gross had a dead frog and bugs in it yuk so did not use it!!! Even more so when I watched a guest with a baby use the hot tub's warm water to rinse a cloth in to wash her child's poopy bottom then put the cloth back in quite a few times!!!! Eeeeeyew!!!! The Singing at the bar in the evening was ear piercing!!!! The singing was terrible to say the least. We did have a good time thank you.

Paintwork needed attention, carpets and furniture were well used and ceiling fans were very dirty. Plumbing under sink was broken.

I stayed first back in 2009 and the resort rooms were nice back then. The second one was in 2014 and when I compared the resort with other ones that I have been able to visit it started to show that the rooms were slightly outdated but fine. This week we stayed at the resort again. As always the size of the room is great, close to mayor attractions, and nice food. Now the room is outdated, even for the size, the TV's are like going back in time to the 90's. The couch had a nasty stain and smelled like if someone had a really bad time there. One of the closets has mold in the junction of the roof and the wall. Also it had spider webs everywhere. The furniture in the rooms was scratched in every corner and even one of the dressers/TV table was broken in the base. Talking about broken stuff, it was amusing for me finding that the TV was broken and then fixed with tape in two of the corners. Another thing that scared me the most is finding a broken smoke alarm which based in the current regulations it is a serious violation of the building safety codes. This is the reason why I'm giving the poor review, the safety of the guests should be a priority not limited only to check who have the parking permit. We have to cancel and check out as soon as we found another hotel due to my wife had allergies and the amount of mold in the room gets her sick. Just hope that they can fix this problems and attract more guests.

Kitchen, dining area and sitting room are all in an open plan layout.The resort was as clean and we'll kept as it was when we were first there in 2009. Though the resort was very busy, once inside the condo you couldn't hear any noise from outside. With the Tuscana being in Champions Gate you are close to I4, therefore handy for getting around. Exit 58. The staff at check-in/Front desk are very polite and helpful.

I had a problem with a charge for cleaning, which we were never told about...either by the travel agent or the resort when we made contact. They also would like you to take out an insurance policy for damage..rate was $39. Maybe if you rent to a bunch of spring breakers, then you have issues, but families there for Disney hardly cause deliberate damage. Needless to say we opted out of the insurance.The grounds are nice, clean and safe. The pool areas are very nice and they have a restaurant on site..we did not eat there. There are many eateries near by.Staff was friendly and we bought our Disney tickets from the booth in the lobby.

Ruined our stay,Jillian G,"My fiance and I chose this resort as we had heard good things. We had just recently got engaged, and this was a birthday trip for me. On the day of my birthday we arrived to the Tuscana after a long day of travel. When we walked to the front desk, We were treated as if we were invisible. When we finally got the woman's attention, she looked at us as if we were annoying her with our presence. She constantly rolled her eyes, and was extremely rude. When we finally called her out on it, we asked to speak to her manager. Not only did he act annoyed as well, he did not act as if what she was doing was wrong. We ended up tellin them we were leaving to go to a different hotel. And all he could said was ""fine, go ahead"". We were ecstatic to arrive at this hotel and start our vacation. Not only was my birthday ruined, But so was the beginning of our vacation. I was in the phone with my travel agency, almost in tears, When a kind woman named Maria who I believe worked in a different department, saw how stressed we were and offered to help. She upgraded our room and left us a care package. Once we got into our room she called and asked if we needed anything else. If it weren't for her, we would have found another resort. Maria should be praised for her customer service skills, And the other 2 should have been fired. I have never been met with such rudeness in my life. There are a TON of resorts we could have chosen, and we chose to spend our hard earned money at the Tuscana where we were treated like garbage. Needless to say we will never be back, but we truly appreciate what Maria did for us to make my bierbfau/engagement trip special. Thank you again Maria!

We stayed at the Fountains Resort. The facility itself, from a construction standpoint, was of the quality we expected. However, the washer had mold inside and did not work. This prompted management to change our rooms which was a real hassle. The room we moved into had a couple of small things which should not happen in a quality resort. An upstairs bed had a problem in that one of the legs of the bed fell off and had to be put in on blocks the next day. Two drawers in the kitchen had fasteners loose that we constantly had to reattach. Initially the water pressure was low, but improved after we notified management. We did not expect these problems in a quality resort charging premium prices.We had a large group and occupied approximately 12 separate facilities and ours was the only one with issues so I doubt our experience was normal.

I was aware of the resort fees and did not have a problem with paying them but if I am being charged a resort fee, I expect better customer service as well as a working phone in the unit and a functional bathroom. My problem started with check in. Although checking in was fast and easy, the front desk employee who's name I believe to be Andre was not very welcoming or friendly. He acted as if my checking in was a bother to him. I knew that I was taking a chance arriving an hour early and that there was a possibility that my unit would not be ready but while standing in line, I saw that guest were allowed to check in so I figure I would give it a shot. Andre was very short and with no explanation told me that I had to come back in an hour. I was confused due to other guest were allowed to check in early. I wasn't too bothered and figured that they could have been owners or requested an early check in prior to arrival so I decided to take the family for an early dinner and return at 4pm. When we returned, we were able to check in with no issues but when I asked Andre about the movie theater that is listed online, he pointed to the check in brochure and said that the information is there. When we arrived to the room, I read the brochure looking for the information on the movie theater and the brochure said to call the FRONT DESK STAFF. I picked up the telephone in the living room to call the front desk to ask about the movie only to find out that the phone did not work. I went into the kitchen and the bedrooms to find another phone but there were no working telephones in the unit. The remote controls to the televisions were also broken. I asked the housekeeper that was in the stairwell to call and ask for someone to take a look at the phone and the remotes and she said that she would call it in. After a few hours, a guy showed up with new remotes. I asked him about the phone and he said that he was only informed about the remotes but would take a look at the phone. He said that he fixed the phone but when we tried to use it after he left, it was still not working. I walked over the office to ask for a working phone and the front desk said that they would send someone over. No one showed up that night so I went to the office the next day to ask for someone to come over to fix the phone as well as the shower door that was off track and wouldn't open and the toilet that ran all night and never filled with enough water to flush. The front desk said that she would send someone but no one came that day either. My husband fixed the toilet and shower himself. I went to the front desk on the third day to ask for a new phone and again I was told that someone would come over but...no one came. On our 4th night we returned to the room to find that they had finally put a phone in the master bedroom but never fixed the phone in the living room.Other than those issues, the accommodations were spacious and clean and the kids enjoyed the pool but that is not enough to make me want to return to this property. We travel several times a year and prefer to find resorts or hotels that we can frequent but bad customer service is a deal breaker for us.",2017/07/24,2017/07/01,Traveled with family,,4,1,,0,0,,,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Live_Luv2Travel,20,4,woman,35-49,35,21,15,,15,2,2,2,0,0,0,56,United States,2012/04/01, 3310 ,25,2019/01/02

Check in was quick and we were directed to our room, in block 5. On arrival to the room our door key was not working. Returned to reception desk, who quickly sent someome to fix the issue. Our room was quite disappointing, run down with ripped chairs and worn carpets. Also old box tv's which were an eyesore. Tried to connect to wi-fi, which wasn't working. Went out for a bite to eat at Tuscana's Bistro, which was lovely and reasonably well priced. Returned to room to discover the door key was again not working. Reception again dealt with the issue quickly. Wi-fi was still not working, we were informed that this would be fixed. The next day the wi-fi still wasn't working and the door key failed another twice. My partner spoke to a lovely young lady, Abby, in reception. She couldn't have been nicer, was very apologetic, quickly arranged for us to move to another room and offered to refund the resorts daily fee (which is for wi-fi, facilities, etc). Our second room was lovely, had newer furnishings and flat screen tvs, it was spotless and beds were very comfy. All in all we liked the resort, clean, great swimming pool, friendly staff and excellent location. The one negative, and this is the one thing which would stop us from returning, is the fact that the ceilings/floors in the rooms are very thin. Thus, if you are unlucky enough to have inconsiderate people above you, you are going to be subjected to the constant noise and irritance of them stamping around their room, opening/closing drawers, etc. We were in room 1304 and the family above us were completely ignorant and oblivious to the fact that we were below them. Their son even had a hockey stick and proceeded to play hockey, in the room, on a daily basis! This is not the fault of the resort but perhaps reminding guests during check-in to be courteous to guests below them, would be a good idea. Would we return if guaranteed a top floor room?

Please note that you will be charged a resort fee payment. They will say in their reply to this post that it is an industry wide charge. But I checked with 3 local, similar properties and none charged it. We weren't told by our travel agents about the charge so not the resorts fault. But definitely the reason we will not return. Considering the resort fee is so they can keep their standards high , we found the standards are not high. From the girl who checked us in, who quite frankly obviously did not want to be there to the desk staff member who didn't report our air conditioning fault , we found the staff disinterested. We had someone banging on our door at 1am , trying the handle and pushing the door. When I attempted to report this to get security to assist us my call was put through to an answering service. The woman was hopeless, she asked me the address of the Tuscana ?? And asked me if I had called the police? I attempted to explain to her that I felt if security could come round and make this drunk realise he was at the wrong door that would solve the problem. She said without the postal address she couldn't help me? Luckily my husband managed to move the drunk on but only after a good 10/15 minutes. If I had been there without my husband I would have been terrified with someone trying to get into my condo. I reported this to the front desk the following morning to have the whole incident laughed at, I was told ""he must had had one too many beers"" and when I mentioned how hopeless the answering service was this was also laughed off ""she must have been a new member of staff "" was my reply. This incident was not the resorts fault, they can't help guests getting so drunk they don't know where their apartment is but how it was dealt with (or not as the case was) was a big failure on the resorts part. We also woke up one morning to no air conditioning. This was reported to front desk at 9am, we were out all day and returned at 5.30pm to still no air conditioning. Not what you want when the temperature outside is 95 degrees!! It took 3 phone calls over the next hour to get someone to repair it. Whilst the maintenance man was in our condo he took a call from front desk about my issue and it came to light that my report at 9am that morning hadn't even reached the maintenance team. It's not all bad, we requested a top floor apartment prior to arriving(having stayed years before we know how bad the sound proofing is so knew a top floor is the way to go) and we were indeed given a top floor. Also the grounds of the complex are well kept. Our condo was not dirty, but a little grubby. Not sure the last time under the kitchen sink had been cleaned, but on the whole it wasn't too bad. For us we are returning since the introduction of the resort fee and for us it's one of the reasons we will not return. We all pay enough to stay without them adding extra charges on. But if they do add such charges it raises your expectations and you want things to be spot on and for us things need to improve. The front desk staff are the front line for customers and should be glad to see us and act in our requests. Honestly your resort was let down by your staffs attitudes and your resort fee charges, two reasons that we will not return. Orlando has so much choice of accommodation for travellers we have already booked elsewhere for next years trip. If your aware of the extra charges and still want to book I would definitely recommend asking for a top floor apartment. Having had experience of people above us on our last visit to Tuscana it was terrible, sound proofing is really bad.

I'm not really sure you can call it a resort.....The good... Smooth checkin, the condo was very clean, and the security gate works well. Nice pool &amp; workout room.The bad... The property seems really dated. Older appliances that are well worn. The staff here isn't rude, but not friendly at all. Very short &amp; matter of fact. The televisions are all very small and the remotes are in terrible shape. Very limited supply of essentials (trash bags, toilet paper, dish detergent, etc.).The ugly.... Given that this is marketed as a ""resort"", they advertise certain amenities such as a grill, picnic area, and basketball courts. So after my daughter's dance competition, we purchased food, charcoal, and drinks to grill out. We were directed to bldg 9 for the grill and picnic area....what we found was a joke. A sad little area over near the run down trash dumpsters and barbed wire enclosure that featured a small playground, 25 ft basketball goals with no nets &amp; a rusted out little grill that was lying on the ground. AMAZING!I went back to the customer service desk and told them (even showed them pics) and I was basically told to deal with it.Needless to say, we would never come back and don't recommend this place.

Tuscana is on interstate 4 so easy to get to the parks.Be aware the traffic has got worse since our last visit.Overall a nice stay here and would recommend this place to anyone.P.s one night myself and hubby decided to walk down too the shop to buy some stuff and a Big storm hit us. Thunder lightening and the worse downpour I have seen in years.We were stuck under shelter at the store for a long time and no sign of the weather improving so made a run for it.Drenched through and thunder cracking above our heads I thought GAME OVER.As we legged it down the side roads a car pulled over and done his window down and shouted Tuscana we shouted yes.

Though, we did not have a great stay, the resort is nice and is in a convenient location. The condos are spacious and clean. Ideally, I would give this place a 3.5, but went 4 as that was the next option: a 3 is too low as it is a nice place. We had proximity to Dunkin' Donuts and various restaurants and shops, along with a Publix supermarket and gas station nearby. The pool area is very nice. For our negative experience, we were given a room on the first floor and right from the start, we knew that would be an issue. Bugs and newts accessing our patio(which had a tear in the screen, was not ideal for us. Several lights were missing in rooms and the dryer never worked, from start to finish...staff simply did not action our dryer issue nor followed up with us or appeared to do anything about it, which was too bad as we were on a long trip and hoped to wash our clothes. All in all, a very nice spot and we likely just had a one-time bad experience. We won't visit again, but I believe anyone else should have a good stay, but try to not get a room on the ground floor if you are not used to Florida wildlife and bugs......it is not ideal. Really, I believe that the resort should not book ground floor rooms unless they absolutely have to. In our case, the resort was half empty, so we could have stayed elsewhere....we probably should have asked, in hindsight.

I'm very familiar with the area, so the location, slightly removed from the masses around the parks, was good for me. Additionally, for the price per night, I don't think you'll find a much better deal. We had a two-bedroom condo in building three. My first piece of advice, avoid anything on the back side of building three. We had unit 3307 and the stairwell light was extremely noisy. Given the typical low-budget construction of these types of condos in Florida, the entire bedroom wall adjacent to this light was humming. It's enough to keep you awake. I've seen a review from April 2017 mentioning the same issue and it's not yet fixed. I think the entire facility suffers from a slight lack of general maintenance. Our condo was great otherwise. It had some wear, but, overall, it was nice. We had 5 adults in it comfortably. The beds were ok and all of the appliances worked ok. TVs in both bedrooms and living room. The pool area is pretty nice. This facility is about 20 minutes from the parks. Traffic is always an issue near the parks, so trying to avoid it is futile. I would stay at Tuscana again and I do recommend it for families and people looking for a decent place for the price. They will charge an amenity fee and cleaning fee, but it's still cheaper than a hotel and much nicer. Free advice from a Florida resident with a thorough knowledge of the area.

My mistake was not to read the entire agreement before signing. The advertised price for the stay is a bit misleading without reading everything. I stayed on night and only used a fraction of room. However, the nearly $70.00 cleaning fee caught me off guard. Plus a gratuity is added in. Anyway, the stay cost me about one-hundred dollars over what i had expected to pay. READ THE AGREEMENT. I stayed a in fine resort with the same amenities as here and all except taxes were included in the advertised fee. The property was close for my participation in a State Charity Golf Tournament at the golf course adjacent to the property. So, I learned a valuable lesson -- all is not what it seems on the surface.

Nous sommes arrivés tard et avons pu faire un check in rapide que nous avons complété le lendemain. Nous avons été agréablement surpris car nous avons eu une suite plus grande que prévu et avons eu 2 salles de bains et 3 chambres... L'appartement est grand et très bien équipé. Un grand frigo, un micro ondes géant, plusieurs télévisions,... Le mobilier est certes un peu vieillot mais on s'y sent vraiment comme à la maison. Le personnel est très sympathique et souriant, toujours prêt à aider ou rendre service. Nous avons eu des problèmes avec le WiFi sensé être compris dans les ressort fees assez élevés pour cet hôtel. Nous en avons fait part au personnel... Après plusieurs essais, ne parvenant pas à nous réparer la connexion, nous avons eu droit à un remboursement partiel des frais ce que nous avons énormément apprécié. Le logement est un peu bruyant mais cela reste acceptable. Nous avons passé un agréable séjour. Merci au personnel du Tuscana pour sa gentillesse.

The overnight amenities were fine and we had a nice relaxing stay even having to get up a bit earlier to get to the northern side of this area. Very reasonably priced but make sure and read the fine print because the cleaning fees and other fees are not included and they tallied up to over 60 dollars.

I normally stay in the 2 bedroom apartments on the forth floor that way you don't have anyone above you tramping around on you ceiling.Both bedrooms have on suite facilities one with a bath/shower the other with a walk in shower. There are 3 TV's one in each bedroom the third in the living room area the apartment has wifi however you do have to pay for it $10.00 a day there is also a cleaning charge $79.00 for the week. Those are only extras that you have to pay. There is another charge if you leave the apartment without getting rid of you accumulated rubbish. You do have to leave a deposit on a credit card which will be returned if everything is ok it's around $300.00.The beds are comfortable however you do have to make them yourself each morning no room service.There is fully fitted kitchen fridge freezer cooker toaster kettle etc. Washing machine and dryer iron &amp; ironing board.Plenty of parking the parking area has been recently resurfaced The pool area has also had a face lift with new sun loungers and gazebos very smart there is a pool bar for refreshments pool towels are in plenty there is a hot tub and a mushroom the mushroom is only for the brave or insane the water that cascades off the mushroom is ice cold not recommended for the faint hearted + it's in the kids padding poolYou are handy to the I4 at ext 58 for champions gate there is a publix's for general grocery shopping a couple of fast food outlets Wendy's and McDonalds a pizza place UPS store for sending parcels a couple of restaurants I can recommend chills or the ale house.If you prefer a bit more luxury there is the fountains villas which are part of the Astons group have never stayed at them but have looked them up on the internet they seem very plush however I try not to spend to much time in the accommodation on holiday I get enough of that at home.One noticeable down side is the volume of traffic I notice this time that with the new builds in the champions gate area traffic has increased getting about took longer so that's it for now ,2017/03/19,2017/03/01,Traveled as a couple,1  ,,,,0,0,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertB164,8,3,man,,23,11,9,,8,5,0,1,0,0,0,37,"Belfast, United Kingdom",2011/12/01, 2104 ,20,2019/01/02

Friendly. Great concept. Love the 3 bdrm condo with kitchen. Good way to save some $$$ (especially with our Canadian dollar). Clean. Well equipped. Nice pool area. Good location close to Disney, half hour from Universal. Good price on flight and condo. Except the airline's now hitting with their big baggage fees. Lower price on one end but make it up on other end. I believe that's called bait and switch....Sunwing. Free mini van ... Not likely. Downside:- Bad water pressure- Three 22 yr olds . No internet !! Bad news. Said he be back to fix. Still waiting. - Free Dvd movies. No Dvd player!! - Not much info at check in about: garbage, recycling, waste disposal usage(do's &amp; dont's), things such as garbage bags, toilet paper, other small amenities. Do they restock or do we. I believe more detail needed to small things. - Door key issues(twice). Reprogrammed door twice. Took a door key to reprogram hasn't returned yet. - Thin ceilings. Had heavy walkers first 3 nights who would not sit down. Last 3 nights new people was great. More work to take stuff up etc...but take top floor. But all in all a good experience. Would stay again.

The reason I'm only giving it 4 stars is the unit needs a bit of paint and polish. That said, it is extremely clean and comfortable and a perfect place to relax after a long day out. The kitchen is fully equipped as is the entire unit. There is plenty of room to spread out. The other item to note is that we were on the top floor, the 4th, and the resort does not provide luggage cart. There is an elevator though. You may also want to bring a fan or use a white noise app so as not to hear the highway noise. It is not bad, but I'm sensitive to that as we live in such a quiet neighborhood at home. You don't feel like you are near the freeway as you are surrounded by beautiful trees and a golf course. It was very quiet around the complex. The location is really great. It is a beautiful 1/2 mile walk to lots of restaurants, Publix and Dunkin Dounuts for coffee. It is a very safe neighborhood and fun to walk around. And you are very near all the parks. The resort has a beautiful pool and hot tub and we spent lots of time there. They provide plenty of towels and lounges and shade. We also loved their free DVD rentals with all the newest releases. There was 3 DVD players, and TVs in our unit. We will definitely stay there again.

People at the concierge are friendly and helpful. I can't comment on resort facilities because we were too busy exploring the place to enjoy what the resort offered. We had two bad experiences.1. On the second night the ceiling in one of the bathrooms started leaking water through exhaust vent. Someone upstairs probably forgot to turn off water. The leak stopped after some time. Maintenance people came in next morning and said they would look into the cause but never came back. There was also leaky refrigerator that needed freezer defrosting.There was also foul smell in other bathroom. They applied bleach but the smell came back next day. They said they were in the process of changing old shower tiles in that building. 2. We booked for a private airboat night tour to see alligators at the counter operated by Expedia at Tuscana for $85 per person. When we got to the place we were surprised to find out that we were overcharged. The actual cost of the same tour was $63 + taxes which worked out to about $78. We were overcharged by at least $7 each for 5 persons. Since we paid the money in cash and we did not ask for receipt there was no way we could ask for refund of overcharge. It is anybody's guess as to where that extra money ended up. And we thought we got a good deal!

We stayed at the Tuscana several years ago and had a very positive experience back then. That trip several years ago, led us to returning recently. The problem is that several things related to our recent stay were significantly less positive than our stay several years ago. The downsides of our recent stay included:-I imagine that during our previous stay we must have been on the top floor or that the room above us was empty because during this stay we were constantly disturbed by the noise level coming from above us. The soundproofing and construction is more like an older apartment building than a resort or hotel. Needless to say, we were up late due the noise and then the noise began again early the next morning. Thus, unless you are a very heavy sleeper or do not need a good evenings rest, this resort may not be a good choice.-A total debacle took place regarding our room keys. We were locked out of our unit on at least 2 occasions. One of which was during evening hours on our return from Disney. After maintenance fixed the room key issue during that evening we were promised it was fixed and would be fine for the rest of our stay. Then the very next morning the same issue took place where our room key did not allow us into our room. I guess you could say that we were locked out more than once.-When we arrived we were given a Pass Code to open the Front Gate. All went well, until the resort chose to change the Pass Code during our stay and did not make us aware of it. They claimed it was for security purposes, however we did not see any sign alerting us to this.-While the Unit we stayed in during our previous visit was very clean, this one had several problems related to cleanliness. It becomes a bit gross when you walk into a room for the first time and Smirnoff Ice Bottle Caps are littered on the floor in a few rooms. Based on what I was charged as a fee for room cleaning, I expected better.-3 of the closet doors did not function properly. Thus, when you shut the closet doors you could not get them to re-open. Seems like a maintenance issue that they should have been on top of.-Several of the light bulbs in the lamps did not work and were out. Again, a maintenance issue to me.The upsides:-The 3 bedroom unit was a good size. The 3 bedrooms, living area, dinning area, kitchen, and screened in porch were all nice.-It was within a 15 minute drive of Disney.-The kitchen was nicely equipped.-Based on being a guest in the past, I was given a Fall Discount Rate for the 4 nights that we booked the unit.I am sharing the following as part of my Trip Advisor Review because I informed the General Manager that I would be doing so. I am also doing so because he took a very do whatever you wish to do approach with me about it. With that said, I would like to share that after our second key issue (on the final day), I requested to meet with the Manger of the Resort. If my memory serves me correctly his name was Paul (I am not 100% certain). I did chose to meet with him privately back by his office (not in the lobby area directly nearby to other guests), and although he nodded in agreement with some of my concerns, he did little in the way of taking action and made in my humble opinion excuses regarding the key issue and gate security issue. For example, he informed me that the key code to our room was changed at 11:00 a.m. on the day that we would be signing out, and in fact the maintenance gentleman that got me into our room informed that the key code was changed at 10:00 a.m. That seemed a bit strange since check-out time was 11:00 a.m. Thus, why change the code at 10:00 a.m.? It then became clear to me why we could not get back into our unit at 10:10 a.m. or so. In summary, the General Manager's approach with me was sort of like, yes I hear you but more of the same blah! blah! blah! blah! I was thinking in my mind, that he needed a course or seminar on customer relations. In the past my family has also stayed at the Highlander over on what I believe is Rt. 192. We will most likely make use of that option in the future. I was sorry to see that the Tuscana Resort had gone downhill.",2016/11/15,2016/11/01,Traveled with family,4  ,,1,,0,0,2,,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H2043YPjamesd,21,4,man,65+,,37,8,History Buff,17,17,1,1,1,0,0,37,"Lanoka Harbor, New Jersey",2015/04/01, 3718 ,21,2019/01/02

My father in law stayed here a few years back and raved about how nice it was, how big the units were and that it was very affordable for being 15-20 minutes from Disney. First, we found bottle caps in the room and a piece of tile by the shower fell as my daughter got out of the shower. Then on our last day there we told the front desk worker that our key was not working. She informed us she would note it in the computer and someone would fix it before we got back from Disney that evening. When we returned at 8:30pm the lock was not fixed and we waited about a half hour until they fixed the door- and the maintenance guy said that there was no note about this situation. What made this even worse was my daughter REALLY had to use the bathroom. To top it off while we were out they changed the key code for the gate and did not inform us- a simple text could have prevented that issue. So if you want a large room close to Disney and don't mind a complete lack of customer care I'd recommend the Tuscana.

We could hear them moving about and talking but in general it didn't bother us, but I could have been a problem if kids were running about for the whole of our stay. Our flat was carpeted throughout but don't know if they were all the same. Better sound proofing we be an improvement . The pool area is lovely with plenty of beds and clean towels supplied.

It's a joke . I wouldn't stay again if I'm honest . Two biggest issues are the walls and floors in the apartments must be made of paper as I could hear everything the people around us were doing in the daytime and nighttime if you get my drift also the apartments are very dated although the place itself was clean and tidy. I've never been charged an amenity fee before and I've stayed in a fair few places . There's also no maid or cleaning service in your apartment . You must wash your own towels and linen. First person I spoke to at the front desk on arrival was rude and clearly didn't like her job enough to answer a couple of questions in a friendly manner .

We had a 3 bedroom/2 bathroom condo that the 5 of us enjoyed and had plenty of room. Since this resort was next door to a golf course, we thought it would be pretty quite. But unfortunately that was not the case at the building we were in. We were on the noisy side of the grounds near the expressway. Very noisy especially when we were sitting on the balcony, but otherwise it was fine. So I would say if booking ask for a unit close by the golf course away from the highway. We also had a surprise when we went out to get into our car to go out to eat on Friday night. A huge hole in our wind shield made by a golf ball. I still have the ball lol. So now our insurance will pay the rental company to have it repaired, but the deductible will come out of our pocket. That doesn't seem to be fair now does it? The resort will not take any responsibility and they did not even know the name of the Gold course so we could contact them. We had to fly out on Saturday morning, so we did not have the time to pursue the issue. This resort was very handy to get on and off the expressway to travel to explore other places. ""We found great restaurants close by that we enjoyed most every night for dinner. This resort had a very nice pool and area with many cabanas; first come basis. Also at the pool area were bathrooms and also a nice little bar and grill which we enjoyed very much. The food was pretty good as were any drinks we had. yes, we would recommend staying here, but get a building and unit far away from the expressway.

Check in was quick and easy. No hidden fees. We opted to pay the $39 as an insurance rather than hold a fee on the credit card. The condo was clean and spacious with everything you need to stay self catering. 2 very large bedrooms with walk in closets and 2 large bathrooms. The balcony is screened which is great. Parking is free. No cleaning service but we are used to staying in a villa so this was not an issue for us, we prefer the privacy.We made use of the free DVD hire. We reall enjoyed our stay here which overall we found very relaxing even throughout hurricane Matthew's turmoil. Location wise we found it perfect, whilst we did not visit Disney during this trip, it is only 1 or 2 junctions away on the I4 or the toll road and depending on traffic, about 20 minutes to Universal. The pool area, bar and restaurant were great. Jacuzzi was lovely.Publix, Walgreens, Chilis, Millers, Wendy's, Red Robin, McDonalds, an Italian, Fish and chip shop and Subway and more all at the end of the road in Championsgate.The only negatives were, we stayed in block 6 which backed on to the I4 which we found a bit too loud - the plus side of this is we were up super early every day with the road noise so got more done and we were a short walk to dump the trash. The other negative was the seating. We found that the couch and seat were very uncomfortable in our condo.

We stayed in building 6 was a little closer to the i4 than I would like but didn't effect my stay, this accommodation is fully self catering so do not get the daily housekeeping coming in tidying up after you but didn't bother me and a small walk to put the bins out, and for me was just outside my building, very clean apartment and 3 flat screen tvs kept the kids happy, local shops include (walgreens, 7 11, dunkin doughnuts and publix) and local restaurants include Chillis all right on the doorstep.Pool was nice and happy hour even better $1.75 bud lights what more can you needOverall a very very nice place to stay and would definitely return for another visit in the future the only draw back is that it was a little bit too far away from most attractions, around 25mins to universal and around 15-20mins to Disney so a rental car is essential don't even think about this hotel if you don't want to drive, nut we really loved the place felt very secure and comfortable.I booked with Thomson holidays and the usual $14 per day resort charge and the $50 cleaning charges did not apply to me a great saving of nearly $200 which you would pay in an idrive resort etcVery nice and Very happy",2016/09/16,2016/09/01,Traveled with family,4  ,5,4,5,0,0,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G1175YDandrewb,2,1,man,25-34,,4,6,,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",2013/07/01, 411 ,8,2019/01/02

We only used this as a base as we were at the parks or out and about most days . The condo itself was huge and provided more than enough space for the four of us . We visited the pool twice and I would give that five stars , clean , towels provided , water at a lovely comfortable temperature and the food was good also. We have a few issues with some appliances , the food dispenser leaked and there was a fault in the patio door but this was very quickly rectified when reported to reception .

The rooms are really spacious and with air con and screened windows and balcony to make the stay much more comfortable. We were really enjoying our stay until our neighbours above moved in. You could hear everything from general walking across the floor to them taking a pee, running a shower, kids jumping about as kids do, literally everything. This was fine we went as a family ourselves so expected to hear kids having fun but not so loud as if they were in the same room. They must of had jet lag as they were up making noise at 1am-5am. On the 3rd night of them arriving we phoned reception to ask if they could be made aware of their noise and things were quieter for the next night but it returned for the remainder of our trip. Its such a shame because everything else was value for money, but with no sleep it wasn't the same. One tip, don't take one single towel with you.

For those unsure where to book this is a good base though it looks further out when you look at a map in-fact is a great location just off the I4 and just a couple exits to Disney and the 192.Champions gate has grown so there are a few restaurants a stones throw away.As to the resort - if you do encounter any issues the maintenance team at the resort are great and will act swiftly to resolve any issues that may arise.Checking in I admit is quite slow and I think the front desk staff could act just a tiny bit faster as the last thing you want after a long journey is to be kept waiting while they tap around on a screen when you are standing there being served. They are polite but very slow!That aside very pleasant resort great pool and pool side bar!Highly recommend for you to stay there and like my self you will be sure to return for your next visit!,2016/08/09,2016/05/01,Traveled with family,2  ,,4,,0,0,3,,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R0b1977,64,3,,,,22,17,,7,7,2,5,1,0,0,22,"Petworth, United Kingdom",2007/07/01, 2237 ,19,2019/01/02

The resort felt secure with coded security gates. Pros: The rooms were a good size and were well appointed with full sized oven, washer / dryer, refrigerator, dishwasher etc. There is a Publix close by and Millars Ale House a short drive/walk away. The swimming area is clean and modern with towels available for guests. I did not eat in the pool bar but other members of our party did. They assured me it was of decent quality and reasonable prices. Good location with regards Disney. Quite a distance from main tourist areas. This didn't bother us as such but may bother others. What I would say though is that a car is ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL! Do not come here without a car, this is not international drive. If you don't have a car then you will pay a lot of money for taxis!Cons: We were aware of the cleaning and resort fees prior to our stay but I feel if they were built into the price of the room it wouldn't leave such a sour taste in the mouth of guests. The BBQ area that is mentioned in hotel literature is embarrassingly bad, so much so that I wouldn't even have mentioned them had I been in charge of facilities. It consists of 2 primitive, disgustingly dirty bbqs that are well passed their glory days in the middle of a grass area that is not lit at night. When I contrast this to the immaculately presented large gas bbq ovens that are cleaned down every morning for guests and in well lit designated areas that were available for guests in the Sheraton Vistana Villages resort where we stayed last year I am very disappointed - a small point perhaps, but we love to BBQ and something the resort could improve upon!The trash area is close to a wooded area and the skips were often piled high with trash, this needs to be kept on top of as inevitably local wildlife become attracted to it. On almost every occasion when taking down the trash, I witnessed raccoons in and around the trash area. Overall though we were quite pleased by the overall package, some areas for improvement that grated on me somewhat, but I believe for the price we paid, the Tuscana was just fine and I would probably recommend it to others. (I should say that I have stayed in at least 5 other similar condo resorts in recent years in the Orlando area and these are my opinions when I compare my stay to other resorts. The other guests in my party had never visited Orlando before and were much more complimentary on the resort.)",2016/08/08,2016/07/01,,,,,,0,0,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/An_t-oileanach,16,3,,,5,19,19,,12,1,3,1,2,0,0,24,"Derry, United Kingdom",2011/06/01, 2119 ,20,2019/01/02

Perfect for families.,Marypopps,"When looking for accommodation large enough for my family, I was quite limited. The Tuscana Resort was an option but the brochure pictures made it look a little old fashioned. Had to book there in the end and pleased we did. Our three bed apartment was more than big enough and the balcony has a handy mosquito/bug net on which keeps them out. Room was spotless and the complex is within handy and easy reach of the I-4 (main motorway). Although not needed by everyone I imagine, the apartment had its own washer and dryer which was really handy for us. Fridge-Freezer, oven, microwave and hob too. We didn't use the poolside bar or eat from there but we used the pool which we all loved. Again clean and a great temperature. This complex is perfect for families on a self drive holiday who are happy to just get on with it themselves. You will need a car! About fifteen mins from the Disney Parks and half an hour from Universal. Also there are two Publix supermarkets close by and a big Walmart about twenty mins away. (20mins seems a long way but because everything is spread out, it doesn't feel it). Airport is about 45 mins away. Away from the main Disney area but within a good reach.

Just be aware that you have to pay for the amenities when you book in(ours was 158 dollars) but this does not include housekeeping as if you want clean towels/sheets you have to pay extra or do it yourself with the washer/dryer in your room) We had a problem with the wi-fi and one of the blinds but this was sorted out straight away.I found the reception staff to be attentive and courteous at all times.The pool area was for me one of the best I have found in terms of greenery,beds cabanas and the bar(especially the girl who runs it with her infectious demeanour).The beds are especially comfortable and makes for a great relaxing day.The pool is clean and there is a little kids pool adjacent with a large water fountain for them to enjoy.This a gated community so you always felt that security wasn't an issue and parking was no problem. As the title suggests the only downside was the location as to get to the parks you have to go on the dreaded I4 with its inevitable tailbacks due to ""drivers"" getting to close to cars in front and causing the jams.There is also only a couple of restaurants in the immediate vicinity and these are inevitably full.There does seem to be a lot of building work going on so this could change in the next year or so. There is a Publix nearby and next to the Publix a fantastic Pizzeria. If you have booked or thinking of booking then the actual resort will not disappoint just the travelling to and from.

The Tuscana Hotel is a Mediterranean styled hotel in the heart of Central Florida and, upon first impressions, looked stunning as soon as we arrived at the hotel. The service at the front desk was, to say the least, quite poor at times as the hotel staff did take their time to carry out simple tasks and we found we were waiting quite often to be attended to by the staff at the front desk. However, the reception area is well air-conditioned and is a pleasant place to sit while waiting for the members of staff. The rooms were as we had expected in the pictures and we were placed in an older room as some of the rooms at the hotel were being refurbished but we were just unlucky to be given an older room. Although it was older than the new refurbished rooms, this was not to say that it didn't fall on expectations as the room was designed as a simple yet elegant room. The beds in both bedrooms were comfortable and the bathrooms (consisting of a sink, toilet and shower as well as one bath in one of the bathrooms) had all the necessities including some free toilet roll that the hotel had left for us. The dining area was as expected although when I had sat on one of the chairs it immediately started to fall apart and almost made me fall which was quite entertaining. This, I would guess, would be down to the age of the room and I'm sure it will no longer be a problem in the not so distant future. The balcony was a bit bleak compared to other balconies I have seen but it had what you needed with a table and two chairs. The living area had a television along with a couch that folded into a double bed as well as a small arm chair. We could not fault the size of one of the walk-in wardrobes which was able to hold all of our shopping as well as clothes along with the safe to keep all your documents and money secure. Additionally, the air-conditioning kept us cool throughout our holiday at the hotel so there was no complaining there as we never woke up due to being too hot. We also had another issue when staying in the room regarding the room's Wi-Fi. We attempted to connect to our room's Wi-Fi but our devices kept saying that the password was incorrect and, after raising the issue with reception, they managed to get us online but with another room's router which meant that the speeds were slower than they should have been. Considering that we had to pay for the internet access in the daily amenity fee, this did annoy us. Finally, the kitchen area was very pleasant. It had a fully functioning dishwasher along with a fridge and a freezer and a microwave. There was no complaining with the kitchen and the washing machine and drying machine which functioned all of our needs during our stay here.The pool area is well maintained and is, from the days we visited, relatively clean. The sun beds are incredibly comfortable however the arm rests are metal and, in soaring temperatures, they get hot very easily rendering them useless as an arm rest. There are cabanas with sun beds in as well as an area for smaller children. The lady at the pool bar was very pleasant indeed and was very polite to us during our stay at the hotel.When you feel like exercising you should certainly check out the on-site gym. There are three treadmills along with some bike machines as well as a few weight machines with the dumbbells at the far side of the gym ready to be used. It is well air-conditioned and I, being British and not used to the heat, could exercise well knowing that I wasn't going to bake to death. To conclude, the Tuscana Hotel is a great place for any family wanting to visit the State of Florida who are wanting a great place to rest as it has all the needs of any family visiting the area.",2016/07/26,2016/07/01,Traveled with family,2  ,4,3,,0,0,4,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cameronf284,24,2,man,,,6,6,,3,2,1,0,0,0,0,6,"Manchester, United Kingdom",2015/09/01, 606 ,11,2019/01/02

So if you have booked or are thinking of please be aware of this new charge!

We had a 3 bedroom and enjoyed the space. The pool area was very nice, we went down there just about every day. The restaurant was reasonably priced. Only issue was the noise above us, sounded like kids jumping off the bed onto the floor. I called the front desk on our last night there, explained that we had been listening to it all week, and I needed to hit the road the next day so needed a good night's sleep. She said that she would send someone up there to talk to them and I didn't hear anything else. I appreciated them taking care of it and the people above me being understanding about it. You always hate to have to complain about noise. Overall, really enjoyed the unit, it was clean and comfortable.

We, like many others, read the reviews on Tuscana and were mixed in our expectations. We can only praise this resort and its staff. We had booked two (two-bed) rooms which were plentiful in size and catered for the majority of items you would need on holiday including two ensuite areas (always handy extra wash / changing facilities) washing machine &amp; dryer and a fully stocked kitchen. The rooms were easily accessible and like the complete resort site were clean and tidy throughout. We were especially impressed with the pool area, which we used most nights especially after a day at the parks and enjoyed the peace and quiet around the pool area as well as the great atmosphere of the well stocked bar and entertainment. The food again, that we tried on a couple of occasions from the bar area was of a good standard and reasonable priced. The resort is reliant on a gated system for all residents to pass through and this helped keep the area safer and more secure. Saw where the adequate gym was located, and although had good intentions to use, i was on holiday so gave it a miss. Enjoyed the freedom of the complex and was never bothered by resort staff who if required were always near by to help with any problems (our room door entry cards failed to work on a couple of occasions) Lots of positives, only negative we would give for both rooms we hired is that possible the ensuites were slightly outdated with showers and sinks, but a very minor point to be raised. Would certainly book here again.Good points raised here does certainly not clear up our other issues with Thomsons who we are e-mailing seperately about their incompetences and who i doubt we will ever be using again.",2016/07/20,2016/07/01,Traveled with family,1  ,,5,4,0,0,,,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dgchalcraft,2,,,,,2,1,,,,,,,0,0,2,"Norwich, United Kingdom",2014/04/01, 201 ,6,2019/01/02

The pool bar staff are great, the drinks and food are decent and not too expensive and they ran a karaoke evening a couple of times a night which seemed popular. As a location it also turned out to be very good, just off a main highway you could get anywhere pretty quickly. Champions Gate are still a work in progress, only close to restaurant/bar a branch of Chilies but this was fairly good. There are two new similar chain restaurants due to open shortly in the same area. Publix Supermarket is just at the end of the road and to the right.

Noisy - The bedroom I was in was against the outside wall closest to the outside stairway. You could hear people walking up and down the stairs. I brought a fan with me that provided white noise which helped with the noise.

Tiene aire acondicionado central con control individual en cada departamento. El complejo es muy tranquilo y permite un buen descanso sin ruidos molestos.

El complejo tiene una pileta discubierta muy linda pero no la llegamos a usar. El wi fi tenía muy buena señal. Reciben 2 paquetes de compras online sin cargo hasta 2 días antes del check in. Cada paquete adicional tiene costo. Muy cerca tiene dos estaciones de servicio con un mini market abierto las 24hs, también hay un supermercado Publix, un Mc Donald´s y un Wendys cerca.

Alternates offered were of similar dated standard. We were extremely upset as we look forward to our holidays in the US, been coming here for 20 years.This is a shame as overall the resort itself is very nice, in a good location at Championsgate. The pool area is nice and grounds very well maintained.We complained whilst in resort and were invited for a meeting with the Management Team. They apologised and explained that these were the only available condos at time of arrival as the resort is extremely busy. They state that they are working with owners to update these condos. We know the resort is busy by the number of cars in the parking areas.We have been given a complimentary move to another condo and this is great accomodation and we are extremely happy and now looking forward to the rest of our vacation.If the Management Team do stand by their commitment to have owners update these condos this will be a nicer place to stay and alleviate concerns of future customers. My advice would be: If you are not happy with your Accomodation on arrival escalate a complaint to the management team whilst you are still in resort. They have fully addressed our concerns and provided us with a satisfactory outcome for which we are extremely grateful.RegardsJohn",2016/04/17,2016/04/01,Traveled as a couple,1  ,,,,0,0,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V4157YUjohna,4,1,man,,,3,2,,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,"County Durham, United Kingdom",2015/06/01, 302 ,9,2019/01/02

We stayed at the top of a block and there was a lift up which was good. One of the only negatives were for 2 nights, the apartment underneath us were shouting really loud. They weren't drunk, but we think that something had happened in the family. The next morning we discovered there was some fresh vomit on the pathway into the apartment block.

Generally WiFi is very good in parks also, Universal, Kennedy Space Centre etc. We would definitely use these again if we are lucky enough to return.

Needless to say we spent a lot of time driving around and exploring. We are used to renting a housekeeping cottage each summer, so I know I have to bring things like coffee filters, saran wrap, groceries, etc. The kitchen in the 2 bed 2 bath condo we rented was very well equipped (with the exception of the coffee maker - 30 minutes to brew a pot of coffee!). We got directions from the front desk about where to go to buy groceries (and spent $18.77 on a new coffee maker - no big deal for a week of great in-room coffee!). Front desk staff were very helpful. The pool area was always clean (and our fellow vacationers were all friendly too). I like that this place will not let you save a poolside chair all day. If you don't use it for 30 minutes - it's not yours any more. As a result no matter what time of day we headed for the pool, there was always a place to sit. I wish more resorts would adopt this rule. We have actually seen people at other resorts who have XXL t-shirts printed with ""reserved"" on them, and they place them over their deck chairs at breakfast time and keep them there all day long! And then there are the ones who reserve 2 chairs for themselves in the sun, AND 2 in the shade. But I digress. Our ""co-renters"" were not noisy. There was lots of parking available. The condo was clean clean clean. I look forward to staying there again … hopefully next February!LHallam, Midhurst, Ontario",2016/03/19,2016/02/01,Traveled as a couple,2  ,,5,,0,0,,4,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LBHallam,7,2,,,1,6,5,,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,7,"Barrie, Canada",2008/12/01, 635 ,11,2019/01/02

We had a two bedroom unit which was very clean and spacious, older model televisions, but good for what we needed. The pool and the grounds were immaculate! Loved the heated pool and pool bar area (towels provided). Free movie rental was great too. I read many reviews before booking and requested an upper floor room due to noise (walls and windows are thin) and I did receive my request. We stayed in building 2, room 2403, which was a close walk to the pool, and facing the opposite direction of the freeway. (Do not stay in building 6 as it is right beside the freeway)The downsides were, the elevator was not reliable in this section of the building. Some days it worked, other days it did not! We told front desk and it seemed to be fixed, but then wouldn't work shortly after. There was a big group of young men's baseball teams staying at the resort, which took over the pool in the afternoon. It was hard for families with younger kids to play safely with footballs being thrown from every angle in the pool. Again, complained to front desk, nothing really was done. Overall, a nice place! Short drive to Disney areas (10-15 min.) and about 30 minutes from the Orlando airport. A few restaurant options nearby and a Publix grocery store too. If you want an inexpensive condo option near attractions, this is perfect!

I started to look at the Trip Advisor reviews a week before we traveled and saw that I should take the time to call ahead and request a renovated room (we didn't get), and something away from people as we were with our 2 kids (3 and 1). So noise from other people stinks, and is a big hassle for us - and we also didn't want them bothering anyone too. I must write that the reviews regarding the staff was very unfair. If you're nice, they're nice right back. They helped with a FedEx package, and called when it arrived and Pedro checked us in VERY early (happily), and he also gave me two movie rental cards when a digging company cut the cable for over 270,000 people. People staying there were freaking out on the staff - but it obviously wasn't their doing. Moving on - the décor is SO DATED and O-L-D. The space is great - very spread out and plenty of room - 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. The rub is the dated beds, bedding and the crappy curtains that aren't really curtains. They only hang from the edges of the windows and DO NOT CLOSE and serve absolutely NO purpose. It was so STUPID because you should have curtains that close all the way across and NOT let people walking on the ground floor look into your rooms at night (or day). Every single door sqeaked and squealed - I mean - come on maintenance and put in some WD-40 or oil so every time you open a door your child doesn't wake up - it was absolutely ridiculous. And despite the bashing - and I'm bashing - I'd stay here again. It was close to the parks - only 3 exits to Disney and we ONLY needed a big place to come back to and sleep. The kitchen was updated and good and the Resort had Publix, McDonald's, Chilis, all on site (within Champions Gate), so you didn't even have to cross the street unless you wanted Wendy, Baskin Robbins or Dunkin Donuts. I've been everywhere and I've been in worse places. The thing that actually ruined it for us were the NOISY Canadians upstairs. They came from Ontario and we SO loud all night and it sounded like they were moving all the furniture around between 8 pm and 11:00 pm - they were horrible. Plus, they tried to sneak in their dog without paying the pet cleaning fee ($250 per week) and seemed like they were staying a long time with about 10 bags. Lastly, the TV's were the WORST.

Washer/dryer within. Full (beautifully cleaned) kitchen with dishwasher. Nice little (small) balcony with bistro table/chairs. A/C unit was very good and we were always able to maintain a comfortable temperature. BUTThe noise levels! It was unbelievable how loud it was .....bordering on frightening. It sounded like a herd of elephants was staying on the floor above us. The noise was thundering. I saw other guests with large dogs in the parking lot so I suspect they allowed them to run freely through the unit above us. The condo seemed to shake and echo as guests thundered down the stairs. I haven't experienced anything like this before. I could also hear almost every word on the TV from another unit. It was again unbelievable that a tv in another unit could penetrate the walls/ceiling so easily.While the place was great and the location very accessible to Disney ...

We were in a 3bdrm apartment - like a house ! Kitchen, dining room, TV room, laundry, etc. Championsgate is a lovely little community with a great supermarket &amp; good restaurants. Easy access up &amp; down hwy 4 to all the Orlando attractions. Our room was fine - not the Hyatt but more than fine. Don't get confused with typical resort/hotel amenities - there is no fluffy doonas or turn down service. This is more like staying in someone's house. We stocked up on our breakfasts &amp; took our own lunch to the parks every day to get better quality &amp; affordability. Boys used the pool/gym which was good. Spa needs attention. Gym was small but ok &amp; handy. We bought tickets from an agent in nearby Celebration which the Tuscana put us on to. That's quite confusing so do your research before you go !!

The condo was very clean, spacious, had all the amenities of home including a washer/dryer. The beds were great and the resort was also clean and had a great and large heated pool area that the kids really loved. There was also a restaurant/bar at the pool that was awesome for those times when you either didn't have any food to cook or didn't want to after a long day out.The only negative about the place was the noise. I am unsure if this is common in Florida where the homes do not need a lot of insulation but there was a great deal of noise that was able to penetrate into the condo from people in the stairwell outside or the unit above us that seemed to have dogs constantly running around and left the TV on loud all through the night. If you are sensitive to this type of thing then I would suggesting getting a unit on the top floor. For us it was only the occasional irritant as we were out most of the day.The resort is a short drive to Disney and its parks as well as shopping around Orlando (20-40min) and also close to Kissimmee (30min).Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would certainly consider them in future.

Tuscana is in a very good location by Champions Gate. The road network is good for travelling to/from the parks. Less traffic lights than on the 192 so a clear run every day we were there. The reception staff were welcoming and helpful and we had requested a quiet top floor 3 bedroom in advance and Tuscana did manage to fulfill our request. The condo was a little dated but it was clean and comfortable with all the usual room amenities of a condo resort so it ticked the boxes. The condo was quiet and we weren't affected by any noise from other guests. The pool, bar and terrace are very nice and never too busy. We had a few lovely relaxing afternoons here. As a base for a busy holiday Tuscana met our needs and the location is a plus point. Visit Chillis located a stones throw away for a very good choice in menu and cocktails (you wont be disappointed). There is a Publix, Walgreens and all the usual fast foods outlets very close by. All in all, I would say that Tuscana is good value for the money we paid. The pool and bar area are well maintained and a pleasant retreat from busy park days.

The furniture throughout the condo was cheap --- the lowlight was the couch that had more lumps than a mogul field.The electronics were comical. The 19"" TVs throughout the apartment are from the 1990s. They gave us a username and password for the internet --- neither of them worked and maintenance had to come. They gave us a whole different set of login instructions.I was hoping the shower and beds would at least work properly. The shower head had no water pressure and two trickles would drop out of the head until we adjusted it --- then we had maybe 5 streams.

The property in itself was quite enjoyable. Guest services within the resort was of high quality and very accommodating. Golf course and pool attractive and enjoyable. Unfortunately my experience in what at first sight, would seem to be an upscale bar, were behaviors by staff in which were deplorable and incredibly distasteful. Service to say the least was sub standard. Surprising when compared to the property. The appearance and behavior of the bartender was shameless and outrageous. Once I got past the hair striped red, tank top and unprofessional short, shorts. I was subjected to poor service to the point of being ignored for long periods of time, while this individual was obviously ""entertaining"" what became apparent, directed toward certain guests and frequents. Performances and antics worthy only of low class. Rude, poor behavior, bar top dancing to say the least was just one of the many inexcusable and deplorable actions displayed. Food also less than satisfactory. How can this frequent behavior be allowed?

Just off the I4, with a supermarket and lots of fast food outlets minutes away. However, if you're stuck with noisy neighbours there is little that the management can do.

Complaints were made and were just told ""they will be checking out today"" the party checked out and had a good 9 or so days... Until tonight. AGAIN, the room upstairs has been leased out to young people drinking, shouting, banging, swearing. We have asked them to keep the noise down and with no luck. Again another sleepless night and a horrible end to a lovely holiday. This needs to be sorted as I am currently extremely unimpressed having to listen to it.

After getting my proof on my pc and showing to reception, who was relaying info from poss duty manager in the back we were told it was there error and they had made a typo in the booking. Gloria on reception handled it politely at all times and i repeat it seemed she was just reiterating instructions from the person in the back office via telephone.We have stayed here before so new what to expect and enjoyed the food served around the bar/pool area. The resort fee was waived by the DM due to the error in the original booking and us having to wait around till it was resolved.The DVD rental included in the resort fee is a decent idea too, so we also made use of this.1 Major problem was at 1 night I was woken in my room by my son saying someone was banging on the door to get in, I couldn't hear as some nights i wear ear plugs and this night I think was Karaoke or something and I was in bed early so had my ear plugs in. I went to the door and it seemed they had gone but my sone said they banged on 3 times shouting. I went back to bed only to be woken by a woman having opened the door to the apartment. She had been given a key card by reception obviously without being questioned or asked for ID shown. I asked her how she got the key and she confirmed this, she apologised said she was in wrong room, I took the key card from her and she disappeared. I tried it in my door and it worked so I trotted over to reception to see why.The guys on the late/night shift on reception said they couldn't see why or who gave her the key as the system was down.We were splitting our time in Orlando with days at the Tuscana and days at a villa on Highlands reserve so I am just glad that she chose I night when I was at the Resort, anyway no harm done as they say. I went to reception in the morning and eventually spoke to Jenny after having a somewhat ignorant response from the gentlemen with glasses on reception.I wanted to make sure it was logged and Jenny seemed to think it wasn't logged and she would log it, and raise the issue of not giving key cards out without following procedure to staff. I wanted it to be logged for insurance purposes in case any other keys had been given out and things may have gone missing on the nights I was staying at the villa. Jenny did handle it well, when I got to speak to her. An unfortunate series of events I know but I must be honest, after returning from a nights stay at the villa a day or so after reporting it I did half expect a manager or someone to have left a note/phone message or called me to explain the details of the key card problem but it never happened, which leads me to believe overall it was not as serious an incident to them as it was to me.So I hope it doesnt give anyone ideas to send a drunk girl to reception for keys hoping they dont check IDs or even names!",2015/10/26,2015/10/01,Traveled with family,1  ,5,3,,0,0,3,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnBoland,54,5,man,,8,55,56,,19,24,6,5,1,0,0,64,England,2006/05/01, 5851 ,32,2019/01/02

These two issued were only addressed by management the following day, midday, which meant that we could not leave the unit. The Unit was nice, but the windows were so tight that we could barely open them, we were hoping to sleep with the windows open instead of the AC, but that proved to be impossible. We definitely did not appreciate finding out that there is that “hidden fee” – Cleaning fee, that was NEVER mentioned when we did our booking. The pool area was very nice, with lots of rules, that nobody seems to observe and no staff enforcing those rules… what’s the purpose of having rules. We had people smoking wherever they wanted even though there were signs everywhere prohibiting smoking.

The gentleman who checked me in was very nice however he left out a lot of information that I needed about the property. He showed me a map and told me that my room would either be on the left side or the right side of the building and I should park accordingly however when I asked him which side of the building my room would be on he told me he wasn't sure he had only been working there two weeks and they hadn't given him the tour yet. We quickly went into the room to drop off our stuff. The parking lot in front of our building, building 4, was very dark and I didn't feel safe . The other buildings look brighter so I'm not sure if a light was out or if that building is just particularly darker than the rest. We we're dropping our stuff off in the room and quickly heading out to dinner when I notice that the microwave handle, see picture, was completely cracked. I took a picture of it to go to the front desk because I wanted to make sure that I wasn't going to be blamed for the damage. I waited for the girl at the front desk to finish going through something on her cell phone to give me her attention and then showed her the picture of the microwave. She told me she would make sure the management knew. After returning from dinner I went to go use the restroom and noticed a small ball of paper in the corner with hair on it, see picture. Pretty gross. The bathroom in the master bath had a toilet that wouldn't flush unless you hand held the handle down the entire time. At my check out I went to the front desk and asked to speak to the manager. I showed her my pictures of the microwave and the hair on my floor and made a comment that we pay a cleaning fee when we leave, and that the room should be cleaned properly. She agreed with me and took off the cleaning fee off my bill. She also asked me to email the photographs to her. I think it was overpriced for what we used it for. There's a charge for the room, a cleaning fee, &amp; a resort fee. So if you're not staying for a number of days or using the amenities it's really not worth the price. We were there for a soccer tournament for 1 night and basically needed a place to rest our heads so I felt like it was a waste of money for us.",2015/10/11,2015/10/01,Traveled with friends,,,,,0,0,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happymomofthree,10,3,,,2,14,12,,6,1,3,4,0,0,0,19,"Atlanta, Georgia",2011/02/01, 1532 ,19,2019/01/02

The Disney parks are a 15 to 20 minute drive away. It was not an issue for us but the only disadvantage I can think of is that it might not suit if you like to have somewhere you can walk to at night - in which case you may prefer the International Drive or Kissimmee area.

We had a 2 bedroom condo and it was immaculate. We stayed at several hotels during our road trip to Orlando and this place was right at the top. Our 6 days here were extremely comfortable. the entire condo was super clean with starter dishwasher, soap, etc.Pros: - The beds were made well.  - The wifi worked fine unlike some people who experienced issues. - apartment was clean. - most appliances worked well. Although we did not use some. - Mari at the reception was super nice and cordial. Explained everything well at checkin and was patient with guests. - excellent decor. For once, the wall art was not abstract but real soothing pictures. The apartment was tastefully decorated. Cons: - Checkin/checkout could be faster. There's invaribly a lot of people at the counter for some reason or the other. So the frontdesk is not just handling checkin/checkout but also other details like someone wants to rent the theater, etc. - Movie theater is not so great. The projector had a green/blue tinge throughout. Wear a light jacket and sit there 'cause the AC can feel really cold. - The fridge was leaking water but it was'nt too bad,so we did not complain. I'm sure they would have attended to it if we asked. - Televisions in the condo are archaic. Old CRT TVs..Wow.. Who's even seen that. There is a playstation that works as a DVD player. But the visual is horrible in that TV. We just watched on our laptop. Overall an excellent stay. We were out most of the time but came back to a beautiful and comfortable condo.Buildings 1 and 2 are the only ones close to the pool. From others you have to walk a little bit to get to the pool.

Upon reaching the hotel we were pleasantly surprised by how close it was to Disney as well as the local amenities such as the ""Publix"" supermarket which is only two minutes away by car. The gentleman who served us on the main desk was polite, courteous and had everything organised. When we got to the block the lift was out and as my father in law uses a mobility scooter it would have been impossible to get him there so we went back to Reception and saw the same gentleman who organised a new room for my in laws for the night whilst the lift was being repaired which it was by the next morning. Upon entering the room we found it very clean and comfortable which an excellent dishwasher, fridge freezer, tumble dryer and top loader washing machine ( for the brits I suggest you read up on how to use a top loader before going). The rooms all had lcd TV’s except the back bedroom which had a 29” CRT TV and where all in good condition, every wardrobe had coat hangers supplied including ones suitable for trousers so you really don’t need to take anymore. The safe was easy to use and free of charge and the Air con was excellent. We had to use maintenance twice during our two week visit, one was to change the battery in a smoke detector and the other was that the air con panel went dead, both were fixed smoothly and quickly.The pool bar was fantastic and the young ladies were friendly and attentive as where the staff who worked in the restaurant kitchen, some people have said that the staff were rude but I have to say that I always found them to be lovely. The pool itself was great and was ideal for families as it was no deeper than 4 foot 6 inches so my five year old son loved the fact that he could walk around so much and even took his first swim without arm bands due to the confidence he found, the shelter around the pool where a great addition but they are in need of maintenance due to the heavy storms the area receives. The food served was traditional American with a few English dishes added in and was both tasty and cost effective (the pizzas were scrummy!)Security on the complex is brilliant with a key pad access in through large gates and gates blocking the exit and we never experienced any issues with loud parties or other such disturbances. I highly recommend this complex especially for families and I look forward to going back in the future",2015/08/17,2015/07/01,Traveled with family,3  ,5,5,,0,0,,5,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/453philc,6,3,man,35-49,2,15,17,,14,1,0,0,0,0,1,17,"St Helens, United Kingdom",2014/06/01, 1577 ,17,2019/01/02

Only downside was having the screened in porch next to the air conditioner unit for the building. It was noisy but drowned out the sound we would have heard from the nearby highway. The pool area was large and we could always find a seat where we wanted. The only downsides were that we were not with small children and the parents who were there did not feel a need to supervise or ensure their children were well behaved (witnessed a child cannon ball into the hot tub multiple times). Also, the price of drinks was high at $7 for a mixed drink. (As a Canadian that meant we would be paying around $10 with the exchange) The hotel restaurant was dirty looking but the surrounding area had many stores and restaurants that are modern and clean.

The location was great, close to Disney, Downtown Disney, other attractions and the airport. The grounds were very nice and clean. Pool + bar area very nice. Small sized resort style, which had a separate child pool and fountain area.The check-in process was very inaccurate to what we were told when confirming our reservations ahead of time. We arrived at 3:00pm to check-in. We were told check-in isn't until 4:00pm but they will accommodate us and that our room wasn't ready. We were not the only people checking in either, the family ahead of us was checked in without any problem. We were told to come back in an hour or so to let them finish preparing the room. We returned in 1.5 hours and the room was still not ready. We waited and had questions about our bill that was presented to us. There were several fees that were being added onto our room bill that were never brought up when making the reservation. When we disputed the charges and told the hotel to remove them they did not want to at first. There is a resort fee and a fee for having the room cleaned and refreshed everyday that was never explained. We were not the only family checking in that was unaware of these charges and fees. Several other people were inquiring about the fees and why they were not on the original reservation costs.When we finally got to our rooms we were not happy. The general cleanliness was very poor. The apartment decor and furnishings were very shabby and looked and felt like a time-share trying to be a hotel. The rugs in all in the 2 bedrooms and living/dining areas were filthy and stained in several areas. There were also several light bulbs out throughout the rooms including both closets. All of the drawers and cabinets were left open when we first walked in, every single one including the bathrooms. The bedding was not on half of the beds either. The couch and chairs had the seat cushions moved and stacked up. We had to call the front desk to have someone come back and reset the room and bedding even though we were made to wait over 2 hours to check-in already. There were curtains on the windows that only closed half of the window and blinds that barely covered the windows. We had wifi, it would come in and out though. I had to reattach the data line coming into router and prop it up in a way that it couldn't move just so it would stay working.The cleaning service we were told would be cleaning our rooms never came, not once. The bathrooms were clean enough upon arrival and thankfully had towels and toiletries. When we inquired later about the cleaning service we were never got a straight answer if and or when they would be coming. By the 3rd day we realized they would not be coming. It was convenient having a kitchen and an apartment to come back to after long days and was something we looked forward to however it was not up to our expectations. Perhaps the cleanliness and shabby nature of the unit is specific to our unit/owner not wanting to update their rental space. The hotel staff told us that each unit was privately owned but the resort company managed everything.Upon checking out we noticed on the hotel paperwork they gave us it stated check-in time: 9:00am!!! When we were checking out the people in front of us were checking in, it was 9:30am and they were not told to come back or that it was too early. We asked the front desk staff which was different than when we arrived, they said we could check in anytime we like and had no real answer why we were originally delayed.",2015/07/06,2015/05/01,Traveled with family,6  ,1,2,,0,0,,3,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/199anthonyp,18,4,,,,31,20,Art and Architecture Lover,13,12,5,0,1,0,0,31,"New York City, New York",2015/02/01, 3120 ,21,2019/01/02

The location was the best part, close to all the action and really touristy areas, but removed enough to avoid the crowds and traffic (easy on/off the interstate). You can jump on the interstate and be in cocoa Beach or Tampa in an hour. Not many restaurants close, but many options within 10-15 minutes.

Sie bediente innerhalb des geschlossenen Raumes mit einer verspiegelten Sonnenbrille, gab sich betont cool und war sehr schnippisch. Auch beim zweiten Mal war es genauso.

We also had a TV in the lounge and an iron, ironing board, tv, washing machine and dryer and fully equipped kitchen .The condo was immaculately clean and straight away we settled in. The pool area was great, very clean and pool a great size with a small splash area for kids and a jacuzzi. The bar is lovely and although we did not eat in the restaurant it looked clean and nice and all staff were pleasant. There are also loungers in the shade behind large curtains that were great for our children to sit in the shade and read. The apartments are about 10 minutes from Disney and about 30 minutes from Universal. Great location!

Well we found it. This despite the fact that there were a bunch of children staying there for a soccer tournament. Our two bedroom two bath condo was spacious, clean and very quiet. The full kitchen was great and the fact that a Publix was only a mile away made preparing meals in the room a breeze. The kitchen utensils were a little worn so you may want to bring your own if possible. The only issues we had in our room were that the handle on the frying pan was loose and the DVD player was not hooked up. Fairly minor issues. The property itself is very secluded and very pretty. We spent the majority of our time relaxing at the pool, which was a nice size and the perfect temperature. We had no problem finding a quiet cabana each morning and enjoying the weather while reading some books. The on site restaurant was quite delicious as well, though they are separate from the resort so you cannot utilize a room charge. Still, it was nice to order food and not have to leave the cabana. There is no maid service, which was fine with us, and you do have to take out the garbage when you check out. Again, not an issue. There is a $35 room cleaning fee which we were aware of when we booked. I thought that was pretty reasonable. Overall I thought this was a nice place for a weekend getaway and we hated to leave, but one must deal with reality I guess. For a few days we had our own little paradise and we would happily stay here again. I should also mention that the staff was very friendly and always smiling. I would definitely recommend this place for a couples getaway, but it's also a nice place for families as well.",2015/05/27,2015/05/01,Traveled as a couple,,,4,,1,1,5,,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SirGriffinStromboli,136,6,man,50-64,125,121,109,Art and Architecture Lover,64,41,9,7,1,0,0,247,"Palm Harbor, Florida",2008/10/01, 16129 ,40,2019/01/02

Beds are queen size and comfortable...also has a pull out sofa in the living area. Each room has a tv too. There is a movie/game rental kiosk in the reception area which has a good selection and is a free perk. The building could use some updating as there are signs or wear and tear..,our suite has older appliances, but they do still function. If there were any maintenance issues, they were dealt with fairly quickly. The kitchen was stocked with basic supplies however some of the utensil pieces should be replaced as they are damaged. I would suggest bringing a dish cloth/sponge if you want to hand wash some dishes. Also there were no hair dryers in the bathrooms. Location in proximity to the theme parks and shopping is excellent. A Publix supermarket is the closest food store and there is the Posner Park shops which has a Ross, Target, Staples among a few other popular names. The pool is fine. There is also a hot tub and separate kids pool. We did not eat at the on site restaurant.

It was perfect for that. We booked through our AT&amp;T Mastercard and got a great rate for a 3 bedroom and a 2 bedroom condo. They were so spacious with full kitchens and walk in closets - very nice large bathrooms too. Large dining tables and chairs in each condo. Our only problem was that two times, around 4 am, there was some type of bird in the lighted outdoor hallway that woke everyone up by chirping loudly non-stop for an hour. It sounded like a fire or car alarm. We tried banging on the doors a little to scare it, but never saw it. Did not know who to contact. Check-in service was very slow both times we used it, but nice. It was a short drive north to the very next exit to get to Disney World. There is a large grocery store at Champion's Gate (Publix I think), and a Walgreens and Chili's restaurant.

The accommodation itself was great - we had a 3 bedroom condo in block 8 which meant it was away from I-4 (closer units are really close to it and you can hear the traffic) - we were on the 3rd floor out of 4 and were troubled for the first week with very noisy people upstairs who insisted on putting the washer on at 1am which is next to the master bedroom and we heard every turn of the drum!! I can't fault front desk because every time I went down they phoned the room (different family staying only for a night at a time) &amp; told not to hesitate to call security at night if it happened again however - no one ever answered. Perhaps Tuscana needs to review this. Overall, I would stay here again but would insist on a top floor unit. We stayed for 14 nights and the second week was more bearable as the owners of the condo were there - they obviously knew how the sound travels through the floors. If you want to use the wifi in your room you have to pay an amenity fee of £140 even if you only want it for 1 day - they need to look at including this in the room price.

I had read some reviews prior to our stay and a few people had commented about staying on the lower floors and complained about the noise above them from other families , this is mind before our stay I emailed Tuscana resort directly (not through our booking agent) and asked if it would be possible for us to be on the top floor to avoid people running around above our heads! I had a response very quickly noting our request although they couldn't promise it, on arrival I was pleased to be told we were accommodated on the top floor as requested so that was great. We also requested a welcome pack too, so glad we did this after a nine hour flight and arriving late , it was great to have some essentials milk, bread , tea, coffee etc. We stayed in Block one , room 7405, I would have no hesitation in recommending this block and room! Block one is perfectly located right opposite the main building and you can see the pool from the balcony. The inside of the accommodation was so much bigger than the pictures make out , there were 6 of us in our party and there was plenty of room. The accommodation was clean and tidy , a washing machine , tumble dryer also , I found this very useful as we were there two weeks and there isn't any maid service, so handy to be able to wash towels etc. Tuscana resort I found perfect, it has a lovely snack bar / restaurant which we had lunch and dinner in on several occasions , it was invaluable after being in the disney parks for hours on end there were evenings we were just too tired to go out and find a restaurant to eat in , the restaurant at tuscana was perfectly adequate and very reasonably priced and great to fall back on. Tuscana is in a great location about 15 minutes from most parks , it has a Publix supermarket literally on the door step, a McDonald's , chemist, pizzeria .I've read a few reviews people moaning about the facilities in the accommodation are old fashioned etc, yes they probably are a bit, yes the television is a big old fashioned one, but come on you're on holiday in Florida, you haven't come all this way to watch the telly?!! And even if you do on occasion (which I did for the news and the kids channels , so what if it's a bit old fashioned , it works perfectly well and does what it needs to do).Tuscana worked perfectly for us , accommodation was good, food was good , staff were friendly and helpful, (our safe stopped working after a couple of days , reported it next morning maintenance man arrived on time and fixed it straight away) and it's in a lovely location. It is a self catering holiday so you don't get a daily maid service but that's fine not sure why some people have moaned about that, maybe stay in a hotel then if that's what your after? I would definitely stay here again.",2015/04/22,2015/04/01,Traveled with family,3  ,4,4,,0,0,,,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charbelle2015,1,,,,,1,3,Beach Goer,,,,,,0,0,1,"Kent, United Kingdom",2015/04/01, 108 ,5,2019/01/02

We stayed here in April Thursday - Sunday and were on the third floor of one of the buildings. The people above us must have had young children because it sounded like a stampede of animals running around at all hours of the day. We called the front desk several times to see if there was anything they could do to get them to be a little more quiet and nothing was ever done. They just kept saying they would call them but never even asked me what room I was staying in. We were in town for a conference for my husband and It was hard to sleep when you hear pounding on the ceiling above you at 10:00 at night.I also have a HUGE problem with the fact that they charge you a cleaning fee. What do they clean? You are responsible for doing your own dishes and taking your own trash out which by the way there are only three trash receptacles in the facility so you either have to walk to one or put your trash in the car and drive there. I have read responses from the facility manager saying there isn't enough room for them to be located at every building but if you have been there then you know there is plenty of room. So you basically pay them a fee to have them make your bed and replenish towels after you leave. We were originally supposed to stay in the hotel the conference was at but it was over booked and were booked here and after visiting the other resort I wish we would have been able to stay there instead. We did not have a choice in the matter since we did not book this on our own. In the future if we come back to Orlando we will definitely not be staying here.On another note, they offer Wi-Fi that does not work. It isn't even worth your time to try and connect to it.",2015/04/20,2015/04/01,Traveled on business,3  ,,2,,0,0,3,1,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kikio367,10,,,,,2,3,,,,,,,0,0,2,"San Antonio, Texas",2015/04/01, 203 ,6,2019/01/02

There is nice community pool to splash at night next to a bar for cocktails and a wonderful Spa set at 100°F (38°C) to relax before bedtime... There is a Publix plaza and fast food restaurants around you can get things for the road of for the room.

Our First impression of the Resort, was This is Awesome. It was Clean and well kept. Check in was a breeze. The Front desk help was great to deal with, we literally walked in, signed a few papers and we were on our way to our room. We walked into our room and it was clean and again well kept. Everyone was very impressed. I have seen some reviews about the TV not being updated. Sorry but we did have an old TV, BUT WE WERE NOT THERE TO WATCH TV FOR THE WHOLE VACATION. The only complaint on the room was that we were on I-4 side of the resort, so when we woke up and sat on the patio, it was very LOUD. We made due though because we were on Vacation. We were disappointed that you could not bring in a cooler to the pool area, we understood that because of the bar and restaurant, but we made due. The pool was a little bit too warm, almost bath water in temp, but again we were not going to complain. We did talk to some that own on the property and they stated that last year the pool was broken so no one went into the pool. small price to pay. The resort was easy to get to and we had no problems what so ever. The staff was great, we did not have any hair dryers in the room for 3 ladies, and we asked and we got them right away. The men wanted to go golfing, so the front desk staff gave us coupons for the Kissimmee Bay CC or Remington CC. Decent golf, but too far to drive to. Would recommend that the Resort work out some deal with Champions Gate golf next door. We did not get that option.The only issue that we could see was that our party liked to cook or grill and the grills were on the other side of the resort. I would recommend that the resort put a patio to the backside of each building and put a couple grills there. Overall we had a fun experience and enjoyed the resortWe had issues with the WiFi, They do need to do something to correct this issue.

Upon entering, we were surprised at how large the 3 bedroom condo was, the carpet near the entry door was dirty, but overall the condo was clean and a welcome sight after 20+ hours in the car. We quickly got rooms assigned, unpacked and relaxed. We did bring our own laundry soap/dryer sheets as the unit has a small washer/dryer, we also brought our own paper plates, garbage bags, coffee and filters, hand soap, sanitizer wipes (to clean the remotes, door knobs, cabinet handles, etc) and disposable cups. There is a Publix near the front of the development, but be prepared for high dollar items. The only item we had to buy from here (aside from our groceries) was dishwasher soap as the condo allowed us 2 sample packets, but we needed to do one more load before leaving.All in all, this was a nice condo dev.

We stayed in a three bedroom condo which was lovely. Very clean and well equipped with the essentials. There is no question that you need a car when staying here, Disney is about 20 minutes and Universal is a half hour away but all are directly off Hwy 4 so they're easy to find. There is a local ""Publix"", but it is extremely expensive so it might be worth the effort to find something more reasonable when buying supplies. This is not a hotel, so there is no room service etc but if you are looking for something at a reasonable price that has all the comforts of home, this is it. Yes the TV's are old but how much TV are you going to watch while on vacation? My kids thoroughly enjoyed movie rentals and the little cinema. It was easy to throw a load of laundry in at night but remember you have to supply your own detergent, dish soap etc. There were some kids in the resort but there seemed to be a lot of ""snowbirds"" too and there really wasn't much in the way of things to do for little ones.

The condo was huge and clean. Free wifi, 3 t.v.'s, a full kitchen with dishes and cookware, a pool and hot tub, and free movie rentals made this the perfect place to stay. It's less than 20 minutes away from Disney World but for the price we paid per night (less than 100), it could not be beat. The only negative is the T.V.'s could be updated and better channels offered, along with laundry soap being available. There is a Publix supermarket just down the street and a Chili's Restaurant as well. Highly recommend the Chili's restaurant for the service alone.

It was very clean and had absolutely everything you could need for the ten days we were there. Oh, except for laundry supplies to use in the washer dryer. I had tucked a few pods and dryer sheets in my bag so we wouldn't have to buy them at the store. That worked out well. We were upgraded to a three bedroom, two wash room and there was plenty of room for at least six people. We wanted a quiet area and they did give us that at the back of building seven I believe it was. The only problem with being at the back of that building is that it gets no sun all day. If you are a sun lover you would be better on the other side. This resort has a lovely pool area. We only used it one day but it was very nice. I was told by those that swam, that is was freezing. We did go in January. Overall, the people were excellent, the location is fantastic. Right off 4. Please be aware if you are driving there, the signs for the resort are not very noticeable and we went right by it. It is off exit 58. We got in at 1:30 a.m. and there was a gentleman there with our keys and such. No muss, no fuss. Had a great stay there and would recommend it. It is good value for the money. Did not use the restaurant as there are so many around, but I did hear from others that it was quite nice. Oh yes, I almost forgot. The door to our condo was broken and wouldn't lock. We weren't fearful but they should see to that. There is a Publix grocery store at the entrance and by entrance I mean you really need a car in this area. It was great for getting our pantry supplies. The people there were also really really nice.

Once we arrived at the ""front desk"", nothing was clearly labelled as ""front desk"" and eventually we were greeted and checked in by a woman who proceeded to be shocked that we didn't have a rental car and unfortunately for us the only room free for us for our reservation was in Building 9, a ""5-10 min walk"", in reality the walk is about 5 minutes from the front entrance, but still. Not entirely convenient with big luggage and certainly not if you were disabled or elderly (lucky for us we are fit!). After being told on the phone before we came that there were no additional fees beyond the price quoted ($99/night for a 2 bedroom suite), we ended up having to pay a $55 cleaning fee as well as $10 for Internet.... not impressed with this.Pool/Restaurant/Bar:The pool is decent as is the restaurant/bar that is at poolside. There is only one pool and one hottub and they certainly get crowded as everyone comes out especially in the afternoon. Get out when the sun starts getting warm by 11am, by 1pm the pooldeck is packed.Rooms:The A/C does not work, we couldn't get our room cooler than 75F. The TVs are OLD, but really how much time are you spending watching them anyways? The WiFi did NOT work, we were charged $10 for this but had to connect to another room's WiFi (and were NOT reimbursed for our $10). We stayed in 9106. The room was clean and quiet. There was only shampoo provided and one bar of soap; definitely bring your own shampoo/conditioner/bodywash from home! The fridge had a leaking issue; the top shelf was covered in water. The 2 bedroom suite is large; you could easily fit 4 people quite comfortable as each bedroom has a large walk-in closet and en-suite bath.Location:This resort is in the middle of nowhere. We took a cab to Downtown Disney one evening and it was $35USD one way! There is nothing around the resort, you can walk about 10 minutes down the road to Chilli's, Subway, or McDonald's.Service:NO room service, valet, bellboy, maidservice, anything. Front Desk doesn't even pick up the phone the majority of the time and you get voicemail. Voicemail!

I booked on 'otel.com' and then we decided to arrive 2 nights earlier. Called their office &amp; nice British lady booked 2 first nights to bridge with our booking. TVs are REALLY old - as is the couch. We knew that about the tv and could cope but the couch was so old and worn it was impossible to sit on. We were there for 17 days so a good seat would have been appreciated. The carpet was so worn in the 1st bedroom that my husband kept stepping on the tacks. 2 tiles in on-suite bathroom were broken so must have sounded really loud downstairs. Bathroom &amp; Kitchen tiles &amp; grout really need a good scrubbing - as do the cement hallways outside of the units. We were surprised the complex needs so much work when it's not that old. In evenings we heard kids running around above for hrs - sometimes until 2:30 am! Christmas Eve was spoiled with not being able to sleep because they were partying - yelling and screaming. The units are not very well sound proofed. Tenants left their garbage bags in the hallway so animals got into them &amp; dragged the mess in hallway and on stairs. It was left there for 4 days. There was a loud fight in the parking lot (girl with a bat) that went on with screaming and swearing for over 40 mins at 2 am and no security arrived to stop them. On New Year's Eve someone had a blow horn that started about 8 pm and lasted until 3 am. We never saw a security guard patrolling like other condos we've stayed at so really didn't feel all that secure. Anytime we saw a worker in the evening they were riding around in golf carts - with NO lights! Very unsafe in fog.

The property and rooms were very clean. The rooms definitely need to be updated, The boys brought their XBOX Ones to play between games, and the TV's were too old to handle them. They were not even flat screens. The bedding needs to be upgraded and updated. The staff was never friendly once during my stay. Upon arrival, they acted like they were too tired to answer questions and just wanted us to move on. Same treatment upon checkout. The checkout clerk never even looked at me when speaking. On my second day there, I asked for a light bulb to replaced in the bathroom and for a battery for the nonfunctioning remote control. The person told me they would be up right away. I waited up until midnight, and they never arrived. In fact, the never came at all during my whole stay. I told the check out attendant, and he seemed not to care. He just said, ""OK, I will tell maintenance.""In photos viewed prior to arrival, the room showed counter stools at the kitchen counter. None of our rooms had them. Thought that was strange. There was a basketball court, and since the XBOXes would not work on the TV's the boys thought they could play basketball. When we went over there, a huge tour bus was parked in the middle of the court.We thought we would have a cookout one evening as the property has grills and picnic tables. The grills were tiny (and need charcoal), and there was no lighting there, and only 2 tables, so that was out too! WiFi and cell phone service were terrible. My friend in building 3 had to go out on her patio for her phone to work to call me .Overall, the property is nice and very clean. I just didn't feel like we got exactly what was advertised.

The manager did not get to the phone but told that I cannot use the room on a different night. They could easily have allowed me to use a room today even if I paid for tomorrow. They did not.

Two bed apartment which was clean and a good size. Decor and furnishings need updating and if you were intending to cook warning, the range of kitchen utensils is limited which is strange and frustrating given the resort is billed as 'self catering'. Couple of pointers:1)The corkscrew did not have a screw! We requested a replacement but not replaced - not the customer service you would expect especially during the low season. 2) you need to stock a greater number of mugs/ glasses 6 of each is not enough.3) coffee machine needs replacing or a good soak to get the stains out. Looks grubby.4) supply cling film, coffee filters and foil in small but useful quantities - relieves guest frustration at none supplied. In the numerous s/c establishments we have stayed in these have been supplied. It's a small thing but adds to guest satisfaction and puts you above the rest.5) install a small safe. I feel happier if my passports are locked away if I am out! The shower was good (but again the tile grouting was tired and gave the impression of being dirty which it wasn't ). The play station froze the DvD image numerous times but we didn't go to watch telly but you would expect it to work if you did want to (it was reported to reception again upon departure). A light bulb went which was replaced in good time. We found the beds very comfortable. Loads of white clean towels supplied. And slightly larger stripy ones for the pool area. The washing machine and dryer worked well.Reception Staff were great. Very helpful. Pool was open til 10pm, clean and the pool area tidy.We ate in the restaurant twice. I recommend the homemade chilli and curry.The bar area was quiet. Closed at 10 if only one or two customers. Bar staff pleasant and knowledgable. Entertainment on Thursdays and Saturdays. Locals drink there so you know it's good. We really did enjoy our stay! All the points raised are offered to management to improve the standard of accommodation. The resort offers Good value and is a great location. If they want to survive they need to up their game with the new competition being built on the doorstep.

The bar was great fun, especially karaoke night and all the staff were helpful and made us welcome. Food was good and well priced. Our 2 bedroom room was clean and spacious. Very comfortable beds and well equipped kitchen for our stay. The TVs are old style but no time to watch them anyway! Free internet by the pool and reception were welcomed. The surrounding area was peaceful with local golf courses close and Disney about 15 mins away. Also restaurants really close - chillis had 2 meals for $20 and permanent happy hour!

We decided to stay in this hotel because it was able to accommodate all of us and it was for a cheap price. When we first arrived at the hotel, we thought it was really nice. It does have a nice look to it and its kind of in the back of a random road so you're all there by yourself so its relatively quiet. The rooms were very nice and the furniture was comfortable. Heres where everything takes a turn for the worst. We left for EDC and when we came back at 2 in the morning after being in the music festival for 7 hours straight and being in traffic for an hour all we wanted to do was sleep. When we get to our room our room key doesn't work, when you would put it in. It would show you the green light and right after a red light so we were very confused. We used all four of the room keys we had and none worked. Not to mention also that our doorknob was broken. So we decide to go to the lobby to see if they could fix it and the lobby was closed . No one was inside it. We saw a couple of security guards standing at the entrance so we tell them what was going on and he went with us to the room to see if his master card worked. The securities master card didn't work. Turns out the thing that lock and unlocks the door is running on low battery. Also the security works for a third part company so he has nothing to do with the hotel and all he has is the mastercard to enter any room in the hotel. The security was very nice and tried to help, he offered us an emergency room but we didn't want to take it because we wanted to change out our clothes and charge our phones. So he called maintenance to see if they could send someone out to fix it. After waiting for 2 hours in 46 degree weather. We decided to take the emergency room because all we wanted was to pee and sleep at this point. When we get to the emergency room we hang out for a bit and after a while we start hearing a noise. I heard it first because it was in my room and then in the hallway. Turns out the fire detectors were also on low battery so they started making a noise to be able to change the battery. The noise kept us up until like 5 in the morning. Turns out at 7 when the lobby opened they went to the room to try to open it and didn't work so they went back to the lobby and didn't inform us. When we went to the lobby around 7:20 and told them and then they sent maintenance to fix it. After they had to change our rooms because the doorknob was broken and they were also blaming that on us. They said our new room would be ready at 12:30. We didn't get it until 3. They had two separate companies clean the room than an inspector had to go into the room to check the room than go to the lobby get the room key and give it to us. Mind you the whole time the new room was right next to our old room. On sunday checkout time is @ 10 and we had overslept a little from lack of sleep. At 10:30 a cleaning lady opened the door to the room and we were still in there. We told her we hadn't left yet and in 10 minutes she started knocking on the door every 5 minutes. This was the worst hotel experience ever. The manager was rude and they were late on everything. The elevator also sounded like it was going to break at any second.",2014/11/10,2014/11/01,Traveled with friends,4  ,,1,3,0,0,,,2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daimib,1,,,,,1,4,Foodie,,,,,,0,0,1,"Tallahassee, Florida",2014/11/01, 109 ,5,2019/01/02

Once in April 2011 and once in April 2014 and are revisiting in May 2015. Personally I can't fault the accommodation, people say its dated but isn't it supposed to have a traditional Mediterranean look (which it does have)? Yes the tv's are old fashioned but who cares, as long as you can watch something! Who goes on holiday to spend hours way watching tele. The pool area is lovely, the bar food great and the bar staff very friendly. The only thing I would say is that I didn't find the receptionists very approachable, we had problems with our wifi (which we ended up not getting for the whole 2 weeks) and I didn't feel that the staff were very helpful in trying to solve this. We had friends in a different resort and it would have made our life a lot easier if we had wifi to enable us to contact them and make arrangements. All in all though this is a great resort, I looked around for next year just because I thought maybe we should try somewhere different instead of going to he same place all the time but ended up booking tuscana again as it seemed the best value for money and I know it's nice x",2014/10/19,2014/04/01,,2  ,4,4,5,0,0,5,,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaimerQ7272TP,2,,,,,2,5,,,,,,,0,0,2,,2014/10/01, 205 ,7,2019/01/02

Check-in was very efficient and the lady was very pleasant and advised that the resort was under new management, so we should notice some improvements, which we did. Pool towels are now supplied in the apartment and no deposit is required, WiFi is being rolled out and was defiantly better around the pool area. The only negative was that one of the desk staff had a real attitude problem when I reported a problem in our apartment. She barely bothered to make eye contact or stopped chewing her gum and I left with the feeling that I was getting in the way of her sales work. Needless to say the problem didn't get resolved until I spoke to one of her more enthusiastic colleagues the next day. Looking at previous posts, this is a recurring comment and whilst the management always respond that training etc will be carried out, this aspect of customer service has so far not really improved in the 4 years we've been visiting. Fortunately we see beyond that and enjoy the great location and facilities. Apart from the attitude issue the only other thing that was a bit disappointing was that the visiting paintball delegation decided that it was acceptable in the evening to be loud and intoxicated at the bar and smoke in the spa ignoring the fact that young children were still using the pool and also to spread countless paintballs around the place which not only spoilt the parking lots but caused a mess when you got it on your shoes and then on the apartment and rental car mats.

After we booked and as we got closer to departure we were getting slightly concerned about some comments made about different things TVs, garbage, WIFI etc. However we needn't have been concerned as we had a great stay at this relaxing resort. TV was a very large flat screen in the sitting area, no problem with taking the garbage to the end of the block we done this as we went out no hassle at all we even saw the local raccoons no trouble. The WIFI was fine no noise from roads although we were on the top of the block. Incidentally before we left like always we made some special requests in regard location, sunny balcony etc and these were all met. There is no safe in the room but we took a small travellers safe not heavy but nobody went near our room anyway and I believe there are plans to fit safes in the future. As these resorts are busy we did expect tired furnishings etc but even this was a pleasant surprise with really only minor wear on some items which is to be expected.

This resort was by far the best we have stayed in. We like to always stay in Condo's so the kids have a separate bedroom. Yes this resort has double beds in each bedroom but my boys where so tired at the end of every day they had no problem sleeping in the same bed. As per other reviews the rooms are a bit dated but they are clean and what do you expect with the foot fall they get through there each week . We liked that the balcony had a net round as well not only is it extra security for small children but it also keeps the bugs out bargain. By far the best feature is the communal pool &amp; hot tub, this is fantastic and you can always get a sunbed. The bar and in house restaurant where lovely and very reasonable. Fab quiet location just off the I4, may not be in the thick of the parks but you need peace and quiet at the end of the day.Only downside was we had a couple of problems with the card key system getting into the apartment. Sitting on the top floor of a building for 1 hour with hungry, tired kids in blistering humidity in August is not the best holiday to be kept saying they have send for maintenance. You would have thought that they could have contacted them by walkie talkie or something and given us estimate of time to help us. Eventually my husband tracked the maintenance guy down on the site himself to discover he had not received the call for our room and even showed us his phone messages to prove it. Saying that once he knew our dilemma he was very quick and prompt. Wasn't just us my sister stayed here in August as well in a different block and had the same problem, as did other guests we spoke to. Yes no safe in the room something we overlooked on booking but had no problems at all regarding privacy and security (couldn't get in the room anyway). I would definitely recommend this condo to any families. If we ever return again we would definitely consider staying here again, just please get the door locks sorted.

Was disappointed there was no safe in the room and on querying same with front desk was told there was ""no need"" as no one could get into the room. Ok. On returning to the apartment, was astonished to find an employee of the hotel coming out of the apartment!!! He told me he had put a resort directory on the kitchen counter! Unbelievable! What if I had been in the apartment taking a nap and hadn't heard him (presumably) knock at the door before entering! Was not at all happy about a member of staff entering an occupied apartment. Also, there are no communal bins nearby. We had to take our trash to the end of block 9 where an open skip was situated to dump our rubbish. Then on looking into the fly ridden skip was astonished to find a family of racoons living there!! Why don't you have communal closed bins at the entrance to each apartment block? Then to cap it all, found out at 9am when looking to have an early morning swim that the only swimming pool in the resort was now closed for two weeks for refurbishment! Why wasn't this mentioned when we booked in? If I had known there was no swimming pool I would definitely not have booked this resort. Am very disappointed. Did eat in the restaurant a few times and would say the food and service is excellent. However, there does appear to be several residents/workers here who frequent the bar and are very loud and noisy. Last Monday was Labor Day and there were several people hanging around the bar when we were at the pool in the afternoon and by the time we had dinner outwith the resort and came back to the bar for a nightcap at about 7pm, they were still there and by that time were exceptionally noisy and drunk. There were a number of families and children around the pool and this was definitely offputting.

Well the resort is beautiful, on the outside. The rooms are another story. The carpets are very dirty. There are more than enough bugs to annoy you. My lock was broken, the wait time for maintainence is ridiculous. I actually, had to stop someone I found while walking around on their grounds to repair the lock. Don't expect anything in the room to be replinished, towels. washclothes, trashbags, tissues, etc. You will be told to purchase your own, or reuse the materials they've provided. Confirm your movie theater reservations because they will book you for a completely different time, and make no attempt to accommodate you. Finally, they will end your stay with that lovely question, ""how was your stay"". Needless to say, my response was far from ""great"".

Two we never saw housekeeping we needed extra trash bags there wasn't any, I was wondering of housekeeping ever existed. We used bags from the supermarket to put trash in and no towels I bought soap and must washed the towels we had over and over again. You have to pay to rent a movie I paid 30 for the week and I did not once rent a movie . There isn't any shopping areas everything is over 10 to 20 minutes away from the hotel .

The use of wifi and the PlayStation 3 has a fee of about $7.99 a night, but with the price of one night at this resort being less than $110.00 for a three bedroom unit, it's a great deal.

Primeiro a localização, excelente, perto dos parques e dos outlets. Adorei o hotel, os funcionários super atenciosos! Cozinha bem equipada, com fogão, lava louças, tudo exatamente como nas fotos do site, também com secadora e máquina de lavar, cama confortável, bom chuveiro, a área da piscina tb ótima (apesar de ter utilizado apenas no dia que cheguei, rs). O hotel recebe encomendas e foi tudo entregue com o maior controle possível, caso queira faxineira só solicitar, mas é cobrado por fora, creio que 50 dolares o dia! Não tem wifi nos quartos, mas vc pode solicitar e pagar a diária do modem, não recordo o preco, mas nada exorbitante.

There's a big pool area and lots of chairs. Plenty of space for parking. We had a 3 bedroom 2 bath with full kitchen. Living area was a bit small but with the dining room, we had plenty of space. Also had a small patio that came in handy. Many places nearby (within a mile) - Pizzeria, McDonalds, Subway, gas stations, Publix, Walgreens, liquor, nail salon and more. Problem was that it was quite a distance from all the parks and things to do in Orlando. The mileage didn't seem bad, but with traffic, it took at least 30 minutes to get anywhere. I would have enjoyed staying here more if we didn't have the parks on our schedule. It would be a nice place to just chill out, enjoy the pool, etc. No wifi was a little bit of an issue - but we got over it.The units were clean, roomy and reasonable. A couple of small issues (broken towel rack) but no big deal. You need to take out your own garbage (no problem - dumpsters very handy) and supply much of your own items such as dish soap, sponge, etc. Again, no big deal because we've stayed at places like this before and were prepared. Plus having the Publix right down the street helps. I was in between rating this resort average and very good, mainly because of the distance from what we had planned to do.

Perfect location, we got a 3 bed condo after booking a 2 bed which was a great bonus. We were in block 4 which a was short 5 minute walk to the great communal pool area, it was clean and had a good size pool and jacuzzi. The bar area was also excellent with very reasonable prices, all food orders were quick and the lady behind the bar was always polite and very helpful. Even when busy it was not over crowded. I read some poor reviews before i came and was slightly concerned but i really can not see how anyone could not enjoy there stay here. Many mentioned the lady at the check in desk but she was very polite, helpful and even apologised for being on the phone when we walked in, we came across 3 other members of staff in the reception who were all helpful and friendly. The condo itself had everything you could want fridge freezer, cooker, all pots and pans, plates etc, washer and dryer, en-suite in one room plus another good size bathroom, tv's in all rooms plus it was very well kept. I really can not speak highly enough of this place and will certainly be back, it is close to all you want inc disney but just far enough away from all the crowds. I work in the travel business and we have just obtained various accounts with airlines to allow us to put together holidays to such places as Florida and Tuscana will be top of our list to recommend to our potential customers. We even ended up here for an extra night at the end of our holiday due to having to be in orlando very early the next morning and again found everyone helpful and had a different condo in block 7 which was equally as good.",2014/06/01,2014/05/01,Traveled with family,2  ,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blueSheffield_Uk,62,4,man,25-34,,30,34,Luxury Traveler,21,6,1,1,1,0,0,30,"sheffield, uk",2007/08/01, 3054 ,26,2019/01/02

It's an easy commute to all of the theme parks and everything you need is right on your door step (eg - Chilli's, McD's, Publix etc...). We stayed in a 3 bedroom condo in block two which, was plenty big enough for us. The decor is quite dated but, who cares, you're on holiday!!! In between our visits to the theme parks, our kids (12 &amp; 9) played endlessly in the large pool whilst we chilled on the comfy sun loungers!!! At the bar there are three large screen TV's showing various sports including English football - thanks for putting the Burnley game on one of the TV's, we didn't do it against Middleboro but, we got over the line against Wigan to get to the Premier League - bring it on!!!We ate at the restaurant at the resort quite often. The food was very reasonably priced and we all had a great meal every visit - you have to try the 'Chilli Fries'. The service in the restaurant and bar was excellent and all of the staff are very friendly.The only reason we didn't rate this resort 'excellent' is because we couldn't get into our room with our key four times in four days. This is the last thing that you need in a heat wave and this was a common occurrence amongst fellow guests. It also took two days to get the WiFi that we had paid for. To be fair The young gentlemen (Andre?) in reception managed to sort out both of our issues but, we felt some of the other members of the reception staff just 'fobbed us off'.If the resort can sort out these two common issues then the feedback on this resort will be very different and the standards would then be in line with the bar and restaurant.",2014/05/16,2014/04/01,Traveled with family,5  ,5,3,5,0,0,4,5,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RAB1234,23,5,,,7,57,41,Foodie,35,16,5,1,0,0,0,65,"Burnley, United Kingdom",2012/10/01, 5986 ,30,2019/01/02

The resort is easy to locate and sign posted off the I4 - a help on your first day in the US! Our apartment was spacious and well equiped - nothing was missing from our inventory and all kitchen equipment was clean. Plus there was a dish cloth a small supply of dishwasher powder etc. Beds were large and comfy, TVs throughout plus good sized bathrooms, walk in closets etc.Proximity to Disney is brilliant, it never took longer than 10 minutes between the hotel and Disney Gateway. As the hotel is located south of Disney you don't hit the International Drive traffic until you head to Universal via that route. There is a Publix supermarket at the end of the drive, plus a petrol station, mexican and italian restaurants and a McDonalds! If you want a Walmart then it is only two junctions up the I4.We had a couple of reasons to call out maintainence; once the door keys wouldn't work and on another occassion the air conditioning stopped. On the first occassion it took 20 minutes and another call for someone to arrive, however the next time we had someone with us within 10 minutes and both problems were resolved 5 minutes later.The pool area was good, spacious pool, plenty of loungers and shade. The hotel was pretty full when we were there but the pool area never felt that busy. We didn't use the snack menu or restaurant but looking at the food delivered to some guests dining outside on the terrace, the food looked great and the menu was pretty extensive and reasonably priced.There is a down side and that is the wi-fi. We'd read other reviewers before we arrived, who had mentioned you have to be near the bar to use it. They were not wrong. However all the parks &amp; restaurants have wi-fi so it's not that much of an inconvenience.During the whole 2 weeks we only had one evening when we experienced noise and that was when an apartment of men seemed to have made themselves comfortable in the hallway and they were still having a laugh well after 11pm. Unfortunately the hallway amplified the sound so in the end we gave security a call. They came out and had a quiet word and we heard nothing more.This is a well kept and well located resort.

We were several items missing from the inventory provided the most important items being the grill pan and baking tray as there was nothing to use to cook in the oven. We bought a few aluminim trays from dollar shop to use. I know these apartments are self catering but surely they should supply a dish cloth and pan scrubber as standard, they supply face cloths so why not kitchen cloths, We have often stayed in villas and they have always had a good supply of tea towels and dish cloths, again dollar shop.We found all the staff there to be helpfull and effiecient and we had no problem in renting a modem to use.We did have a couple of noisy nights with neighbors but realsise that everyone was there on holiday and it was not constant or every night.The pool area was clean and well kept and the free cabanas ideal for keeping out of the sun at lunch time.

When we asked about WiFi, we were told that we had to rent a router for an extra charge but they didn't have one available, We had to wait a day to get one and run to the desk in the morning before they were all spoken for. There was no newspaper available. There were no weights or weight machines in the gym. It shouldn't be classified as a gym in my opinion. The decor is very early 90's and seems quite dated and tired. The kitchen was not properly stocked. it had no toaster, baking dish or broiler. I called down and they were quickly supplied.The twin beds in the 3rd room are not suitable for 6 ft young men. their feet hung over the end of the beds which did not make for a great sleep.The bedroom curtains are not functional just decorative so the only black out is very cheap blinds which didn't work very well.We had to call 3 times about noisy neighbors upstairs.We nicked named them the rhinos for their heavy pounding and jumping from 7 am to 11 pm.

Day 1, we slept in the rental car because the sheets on the bed appeared to already have been slept on and dirty, so we had to wash them. We got in very late from our activities on Wednesday so we were too tired to wait for the sheets to wash and dry so we just took a loss and slept in the van. I did call the front desk, I did not get an answer so I left a message on the voice mail, they never returned my call. Also after taking off the sheets and pillowcases to wash them, the mattress pads were dirty, there was a blood stained pillow, which was very visible by the way, and a urine stained pillow, both of which should have been disposed of when the housekeeper saw the stains and I have pictures to prove it. That's very unsanitary. Housekeeping did not come the entire time we were there to replenish towels, tissue, etc. The dryer stopped working, there were black bugs in one of the beds, one of the shower floors was just outright filthy and the curtains in the living room were dirty as well. The filth of this place played an important role in my decision whether or not to purchase a timeshare. If I were an owner I would be quite upset that my place was not being kept up to par. The guests above us had children that ran, fumbled and bumped from sun up to sun down, basically all day and all night, it was quite nerve wrecking.

Very nice property. We were on the 4th floor which I happen to think is the best because there is no one above you making noise. Had very little to do with the staff...office or othrwise. but the office staff was a little stuffy. Seemed like they were there to sell property not to make staying guests comfortable. The property is so very centrally located we went to Central Business District...Universal Studios, Bubba Gumps, Hard Rock the night we got there. Epcot Center twice, Downtown Disney, The Kennedy Space Center &amp; the Tampa Hard Rock. And still had a few days of down time to prepare to go to Costa Rica. The property is very nice. It is not a HOTEL. These are individually owned condos which you have to provide everything including salt &amp; pepper, laundry supplies,electric dish soap &amp; garbage bags. They have washer &amp; dryers in each unit so you can do your own clothes &amp; linens. Pool towels are provided so you are not resposible for washing those. Just be sure to go to a store &amp; pick up everything you would need to eat for the same amount of days at home. We have our own moble 4-g wi-fi hot spot so not having wi-fi provided by properties is not a problem for us. It is worth the price through our carrier to have this everywhere that has a cell system.Rooms were very comfortable. Had extra bedding because we did not use the sofa as a bed. Never had time to spend at the pool but sure saw a lot of people using it. One really nice thing about the property is that every unit had a balcony/patio which was enclosed with screen. LOVED that.

Make sure not to leave trash in the room or you'll get charged for trash. The pool area was nice. The pool is definitely not heated. They do have a few heated vents at the bottom of the pool but the water was freezing even in 75 degree weather. They do have karaoke on Thursday &amp; Saturday nights.

Não há serviço de quarto, não há limpeza, troca de toalhas ou coisa assim. Você retira o seu próprio lixo, lava as próprias louças, faz as camas, etc.Cada apartamento possui água quente, cozinha completa com forno, fogão, geladeira, microondas, lava louças, máquina de lavar e de secar, ar condicionado, varanda.O local é bem seguro e próximo da Disney, porém fica a cerca de 20-30 minutos do centro de Orlando, sendo assim se você possui muitos assuntos nesta região, este pode não ser o melhor resort. O acesso a rodovia é fácil e possui um publix bem perto.Indico fortemente para famílias com crianças pequenas, pessoas que pretendam ficar vários dias na cidade, pessoas que prefiram cozinhar e grupos de casais que possam dividir o apartamento.Dica: Ao sair, retire todo o lixo do apartamento, pois eles cobram uma taxa de retirada do lixo.

Eramos 4 (2 mayores y 2 niños) y el lugar es sumamente grande, con una cocina-sala, 2 habitaciones, 2 baños completos, y todo lo que se necesita para disfrutar Orlando: lavarropas, secarropas, lavavajillas, etc.No hay servicio de mucama, pero uno esta poco en el hotel y casi no ensucia, hay aspiradora por si alguno es muy maniatico de la limpieza.Tiene una linda pileta (casi no la usamos) y un bar para tomar algo a la noche o cenar o desayunar si quieren, que tampoco usamos.Tambien tiene un gimnasio que es correcto, con 3 cintas para correr, otras tantas bicicletas y algun aparato multiple. Si son los que no abandonan el ejercisio ni siquiera en vacaciones, el gimanasio les va a servir de ayuda, y tambien al estar en medio de una zona boscosa, esta bueno para salir a correr por los caminos internos, casi sin trafico.La atencion es correcta, no sobra nada pero tampoco falta nada.Ventajas:- Grande y comodo- Excelente precio comparado con Resorts similares- Estacionamiento incluido- Dejan recibir paquetes que uno encarga por Amazon o similar.- Incluye internet solo por cable en las habitaciones- Wifi en la zona de pileta.- Dejan imprimir sin cargo tickets o cualquier cosa que uno necesite imprimir de ultimo momento (para mi fue muy comodo, ya que hay muchos tickets que podes imprimirlos por tu cuenta y llevarlos).- check in y check out perfectos, sin sorpresas de tarifas ni gastos no anunciados.- IMPORTANTE PARA TENER EN CUENTA SI ESTAN COMPARANDO RESORTS CON OTROS SIMILARES: NO COBRAN RESORT FEE !!! Tengan en cuenta esto, ya que la mayoria si lo hacen (alrededor de 10 dolares por dia por adulto) y generalmente esta en letra chica y uno no lo sabe hasta que paga su cuenta al final de la estadia.Desventajas:- No hay Wifi en las habitaciones, hoy es dia es fundamental para conectar diferentes aparatos.- Muy malo el sistema de oscuricimiento de las habitaciones. Para los que les gusta dormir totalmente oscuros como yo, aca la van a pasar mal, por mas colchas o frazadas que intenten poner para tapar la entrada de luz. Solo hay un sistema de cortinas americanas, que no sirve para nada. Recomendaria que coloquen cortinas black out encima de estas.- Las camas son chicas, cada cuarto tiene 2 camas matrimoniales de no mas de 1,40 o a lo sumo 1,50 de ancho, incomodas.- Para peor las sabanas que usan son cortas, o sea que se que salen del colchon y uno tiene que elegir taparse de la mitad para arriba o de la mitad para abajo, porque no alcanza para todo el cuerpo.- A pesar que la cocina viene bien equipada con utensillos que se necesitan para vivir, los mismos son demasiados justos, podrian tener un poco mas de cantidad de platos, cubiertos, algunos elementos mas de cocina, etc.- La ubicacion no es la mejor, queda un poco lejos de todos los parques, no es grave, pero siempre hay que andar por lo menos 20 minutos para ir a un parque.

It never worked for us.My husband walked in to the main building from the pool area and was yelled at to put a shirt on, there were no signs any where indicating that a shirt was required. Again, it is all about customer service and not screaming at a guest. You cannot call room to room or even contact the front desk because the button on the phone that says "" front desk"" reroutes you to a central number, almost like calling for a taxi. You cannot get a hold of a ""live "" person. I had to walk down to the front desk which is only open between 8 am - 5 pm!! Are you kidding me?? Upon check out you have to remove all your garbage yourself, which I find ridiculous considering the amount you pay to stay there, with no maid service at all, all week.There is not one person that you see present, that seems to be capable of running the condos.

We stayed previously and had a few issues with noise from an apartment above from what seemed to be a family who appeared to permanently live there so when I saw some of the recent comments on here about noise levels alarm bells rang in my head so I emailed Toscana and they said they would try to ensure I had a top floor apartment which we had and it was great , three bedrooms but we only paid for a 2 , clean as always, new flat screen tv in lounge and new sofas , tiled floors throughout and fully equipped washer dryer etc. the key cards which seem to be an issue we had problems with too .. It would appear and would have been nice to know this ... Mobile phones wipe them !! So if you store your phone and key card in your bag together it will wipe the card and then a trip to reception to get a new one is required which did happen to us ! Maybe a mention of this to guests may help ? We also had a problem with lights ..

The condo was much larger that expected (3 bedr). It has everything you'll need, full equipped kitchen, television in every room and in-condo laundry facilities. Stayed in block 1, next to the pool area, great location, especially in the evening, if you felt to tired to walk over to the bar to listen to some music, you could just sit outside on the porch. We had problems with our Aircon one night, but the maintenance arrived within few minutes and brought it up to work again in no time. Our last day, we had lockout, none of the keys worked, but again the maintenance came to resolve it. Later the same day, we had lockout again, but it took a bit longer time to get it resolved, but in the end the maintenance came and opened for us. It was a bit irritating thing, have to wait outside your condo after a long day out. The whole area was clean and tidy including the pool area, which was frequently enjoyed. Especially during the evening time, where most people are sitting by the bar, you almost have the whole pool by yourself and can have a swim and enjoy a bit of a music at same time. Tuscana is located only minute away from the I-4 exit 58, so it's a great location considered that I-4 runs through the Greater-Orlando are, where all the famous parks, shops, restaurants, etc..., are located. Nearby Tuscana is supermarket, gas station, restaurants etc..., and only ten-minutes drive away you will find larger shopping complex which includes Target, Best Buy plus more chain stores. I will definitely return to Tuscana Resort again next time when I visit Orlando, it is so convenient to have a home away from home, which also is spacious and within few miles from all the best Orlando has to offer. Room was super-clean at arrival, we had order a food pack prior to arrival, which comes in good use if you arrive late, so you don't have to rush into the supermarket the morning after to buy food. Living room has very large flatscreen TV, as well internet cable (which could be slightly longer).

Not really what you want after a long, hot day at a theme park.Also the grounds where not maintained as well as they had been in previous years. More litter and worse of all dog mess around the place than we had noticed in previous visits.When we visited they had an issue with a faulty fire alarm which for a day and a half went of randomly. Resulting in various trips from the local fire brigade and a lovely 2am wake up call for the guests in block 3. No apology was made by anyone at Tuscana for wakening up their guests with the faulty alarm, which had gone of 4 times during the day. At check out when I was asked how may stay was I mentioned the fire alarm situation and the gentleman made no apology and really obviously wasn't bothered. But then again it wasn't him woken at 2am.We always loved the Tuscana, hence this was our 3rd visit in 3 years but we are sadly booking different accomodation next year.",2013/10/26,2013/10/01,Traveled with family,2  ,4,3,4,0,0,4,3,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/disneyfanScotland,21,5,woman,35-49,3,55,28,,39,2,8,3,3,0,0,58,scotland,2007/07/01, 5628 ,25,2019/01/02

Due to an injury, I checked out on the forth night of my 5 night pre-paid reservation. The day after I left I was contacted by office staff asking when I was going to check out. I informed them that I had followed their procedures for check out when the office was closed and that I had left my card key in their drop box. They confirmed that the information was understood so I thought no more about it until a charge was placed against my debit card for $94.24 a full 5 days later. I have been in contact with the manager since I challenged the charge with my bank and have had no satisfaction for the last four days.

The week during our stay, they had karaoke night for I believe the whole week we had stayed there. All public areas of the resort were well maintained. It was truly evident that the staff work hard to maintain the resort. The resort is near all of the major parks such as Disney and a few miles away from a Wal-Mart and the Orlando Premium Outlets store. The resort was located in the beautiful ChampinsGate.

Make sure you look out for that!Oh, we found chicken bones and left over chicken under the sink next to the garbage can! I wonder about cleanliness.People next door made a ton of noise for 2 weeks, banging on walls, yelling, running around, and no one did anything about it. I called the front desk 4 times and went to see them twice. I barely slept at all in these 2 weeks. Noise was continuous through all hours of the night. They kept saying ""we can't do anything"". They didn't even try to make it better! I would have thought they would have comped us Internet or something to make up for the inconvenience! Customer service = 0.The room itself was noisy. We heard the water through the walls, doors slamming, the fridge and the ac vent.It's further than stated on their site. It's at least 20 minutes away from everything, outlets, malls, universal and disney parks. So be prepared to drive. Closest thing is Hollywood studios 13 min away. The upside, publix, Chili's, subway, Mc Donald's, Pizza Hut, dunkin donuts, a 7 eleven and the I-4 were super close.The ""business center"" is one computer in their ""main lobby"" you have 15 minutes to use it (max) and you can't even sit. And it's only open when the people are working so if you have an early flight and would like to ""check-in to your flight"" early don't even think about doing it there. It was super super slow, took forever! Printer was ""down"". And who doesn't offer free wi-fi these days! Calls are even ""barred"" from the phone.Pool is smaller than we thought. I wonder if the elevator is up to code. The paper in the elevator stated it was good until august 1st.... We left a couple of days ago and it wasn't changed. The beds are tiny! And the sofa bed wow we closed that thing faster than we opened it! Can honestly say, I will never be coming back here. We read the reviews and said ""well there are good ones!

The condo was totally clean when we arrived, had 3 brand new Samsung Smart TVs in each room and double beds in both rooms ( perhaps the only downside was the comfy ness of the mattress on the sofa bed, and a lack of single beds for the kids so we all had to double up) but we were barely disturbed by any noise whatsoever. The staff were friendly and helpful, the pool was exceptionally good, clean and safe( no deeper than 4ft 9 I think) which meant our 6 year old daughter had an absolute fantastic time in the pool with her 3 older brothers. As for Disney being too far away, that's nonsense too, unless your going to walk there of course, Disney is 4 junctions up on the I4 (jct 62), Tuscana is at jct 58. Takes just 20 mins or sodriving. Amenities near by are good, 7-11, Publix supermarket, Chinese takeaway, French restaurant, McDonald's , Chillis Restaurant, Subway, hairdresser/barber, off licence/liquor store to name just a few , just half a mile walk or 2 mins in car from gates of the condo complex... All in all it's a fantastic place to stay and I'd fully recommend it to my friends and family... Oh and one highlight of our stay, swimming in the pool at 10pm at night, the pool water as warm as the air outside after being heated by the sun all day and in the distance watching thunder and lighting take place in the distance...

We arrived after a long day to a clean apartment on the top floor and the only point to note on entry was one of the bedroom blinds was broken. We reported this the next day and it was replaced quickly. The resort is very close to the major parks and has a Chilis restaurant very close by if you need it plus a publix supermarket and Walgreens and pizza restaurant. We tried the food a tuscana after a few days and wished we'd found it before! It is not international haute cuisine, but is great food and great prices. The hot wings are great and my only regret was not being able to eat the full menu! We did not experience any of the criticisms voiced on here...apartment very clean and tidy, not noisy and we had everything we needed. I would like to say a special thank you to the lovely bar staff of Candy, Lauren and Jenny. Some nights it was very busy and they were so nice to us from day 1...fab ladies, all 3 and a credit to the Tuscana. We had said that this (2nd) trip to Orlando would be our last but we really want to visit again and plan to return in 2015 (would have been sooner but next years holiday is booked). This accommodation is not for everyone...you could get a lot cheaper hotel on International Drive but I'm a firm believer in you get what you pay for and this was real value for money. My only advice to Tuscana maybe to add a complimentary starter pack for guests...even if it just tea and coffee for first night.....this really would add the nicest touch.

We stayed on the ground floor in a 3 bed apt in block 5. Didn't have any major noise issues. Certainly none from the I4 road as a few have mentioned. Could here the AC units starting up and the people upstairs every now and then, but nothing major. The apartment was well equipped and furnished to a good standard. All good equipment in the kitchen area and the washer/dryer was a Godsend. The whole apartment was fully air conditioned which worked great, cos you need it. The pool area was ideal for relaxing at and the food and drink at the bar was both reasonably priced and good quality. Perhaps the only slight negative on our part was, at night the bar area is more suited to adults not younger kids. We didn't have any problems with the apartment, however there did appear to be a well manned team buzzing around on their golf carts that probably would have been able to sort any issues. Check in was a breeze, much easier than many hotels I've stayed at. Yes, they do take a deposit on your credit card but totally understand why. After all it is someone else's house you're living in. If it was your house you'd like the piece of mind that any damage, accidental or otherwise would be taken care of. All in all an excellent base for our Florida holiday. Very close to the Disney attractions and 192 Kissimmee 10-15 min drive. A bit longer to the Universal attractions and International Drive areas, especially if the traffic was playing up.

Originally we were just going to drive back and forth. After all, it is only an hour drive from our house. Then it hit me! Let’s stay at a resort and make it a mini vacation to kick off the summer. On May 28th she spoke to the Tuscana Resort and made our reservations to check into a two bedroom suite. We were all set to check in on May 31st and to check out on June 2nd. Friday arrived and we were all set. Everything was packed and ready for a great weekend! We had some issues at home though that we had to address before we could get on the road. She called the hotel to notify them that we're not sure we would be there in time to check in by 10pm and to please put the key in the box if were had not arrived by 10pm. She was told where the box was located and given the key code to retrieve our key and instructions. We arrived at the hotel at 10:30 pm, parked under the overhang and went to the lock box to retrieve our key. Upon opening the box it was completely empty! However, she noticed some people standing inside at the desk. When we went to open the door however, it was locked. When she knocked another guest let me in. We saw her name on the welcome sign and thought it was pretty neat! One of the guests at the desk seemed to be having issues with their deposit so we waited in line. After about five minutes of waiting a gentleman asked if he could help us. She told him we are here to check in and that the key was not in the box. He took our name and went to get another man from the back because his stack of keys were all mixed up and just had room numbers on them. After the second man came out he gave me my room number and my key as well as an Insider’s Guide to Walt Disney which had the resort map and gate code on the back. He showed her on the map where our room was located and where we should park. She asked if he needed anything else and was told no. So we left the front desk with the map and key and was ready to get settled into our suite.When we arrived to the unit we found it clean and well kept. We had a full kitchen with full size appliances including a stove/oven, Dining room, Living room, screened patio. Two bedrooms with walk in closets, as well as two bathrooms. It was great! I walked around to all the doors and windows to make sure they were locked, just as I does any place we stay. As I made the rounds checking it all out he realized all the air vents were closed, so I took a chair around to each of them so I could reach and open them. The next thing we noticed was the false drapes in the bedrooms. On either side of both windows were a single drapery panel hung to look like open drapes, however they were not on functional rods and could not close to cover the window. The only things covering each bedroom window were thin mini blinds. Since we were facing a parking lot, the rooms were fully illuminated even with the blinds closed. My wife have a very hard time sleeping with any light so this was a definite drawback for her! The two bedrooms and the living room all three had a 19-22 inch tube TV. I was not very impressed by the lack of updating to the TV’s. The size and age of the TV’s did not bother her as much as not having local news channels available to watch on them. The bath tub in the unit was so slow to drain. She finally had to unscrew the drain plug completely just to try to get the water out faster. 8 inches of water in the tub only drained to 4 inches of water in 2 hours! After removing the drain plug completely the water drained quickly. It had one of those fancy push button drain plugs, step once to close and again to open… all it did was block the water, even in the open position. Finally after the shower it was time to sleep. Both rooms had a queen size bed. The beds were firmer than I like, but were ok for a couple nights.Saturday morning we woke up and made pancakes in our room for breakfast then headed off to Typhoon Lagoon to spend the morning. After Typhoon Lagoon we went back to our neighborhood for our annual block party. When the party was over we took our girls (ages 8 and 5) and headed back to the resort. When we arrived back our room key would not work, so to the front office we went. Since it was after 10pm the office was closed. On the door is a sign with a phone number to call as well as a phone to use to call the afterhours staff. She called using her cell phone so she could wait in the car. After 20 minutes of listening to “elevator music” she decided to walk into the bar to see if there was someone there who could help us. After speaking to the nice man who runs the resort bar she was informed that she was actually on hold with an answering service and they would have to try to reach whoever was on call for the night and that he had no access to anything to do with the resort and it could take hours to get into our room. Finally after 30 minutes of being on hold a person answers the phone and takes my info. She told her the on call person will call her back shortly. She walked back out to the car where I and sleeping kids were waiting. I am completely fed up by this point. I decided that I am going to go inside to the bar to use the bathroom and we will try our key one last time before going home. I've been wearing contacts all day and they were bothering my eyes, thankfully we had my glasses with us, but not the lens case/solution. it was in our suite. I took my contacts out and threw them away wasting a brand new pair of month long contacts. When we went back to the room to try for one last time, I noticed a man with a clipboard near our room looking around. This was apparently the on call person there to let us in. The on call person however NEVER tried to call us. We finally made it into the room at 11:30pm got the kids settled into bed and then showered. By the time we made it to bed it was almost 2 am and there was no way we were going to be able to wake up in the morning to go to Disney World with the kids.Sunday morning we woke up around 9am she went straight to the office to find out about our key and to check out while I made us breakfast in the room. The lady in the office said that the key was only programmed to work for one night and we were supposed to come back on Saturday morning to check in… My wife thought that’s what she did Friday night!? Needless to say, she were upset. She checked out with the credit card that the resort had on file and went back to our room. There was no way my wife and I were going to last all day at Disney so we had to disappoint our girls and tell them we couldn’t go. Since our tickets expire the 7th this was our last weekend to be able to use them up. The girls watched a little TV in the room while I packed up everything and we left the resort at 11am. On the way home we stopped by the Florida Mall and let the girls get some m &amp; m’s from the m &amp; m store. While this mini vacation turned into a major disappointment for our family, I’m hoping the girls will only remember the fun stop at the mall and not the fact that they didn’t get to go to Disney.To make matters worse, Disney raise the ticket prices the very next day. Since my wife and I had tickets to use for this trip were would have all had tickets. Our tickets however expire on the 7th of June, which means if we try to come back later in the summer we will have to spend an additional $201.40 on tickets for me and her to use. While we thought the resort was nice and had a great location, we would never feel comfortable staying there again unless there was a staffed front desk 24/7. The last thing you want is to be locked out of your room with no place to go in the middle of the night with two small children, even if home is only an hour away.",2013/06/16,2013/06/01,Traveled with family,4  ,3,1,3,0,0,2,1,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RicardS802,1,,,,,1,4,,,,,,,0,0,1,"Melbourne, Florida",2013/06/01, 104 ,5,2019/01/02

The Tuscana Resort is conveniently located right off I-4 and is down a quiet road with no other properties on it, so quiet in fact that I almost turned around to make sure I was heading the right way. This resort was great for a weekend, but I would be a bit disappointed if I were staying there on vacation. The pool area is clean and nice. However, there is only 1 pool, and it is only located close to the lobby. You would really have to do some walking if you were in building 9. I found it funny that they refer to the area that building 9 is located in to be the ""conservation area"" especially because the 1st thing you see is a massive back-flow prevention system and a series of 2 dumpsters.The rooms are clean with granite counter tops, showers were poorly constructed, and not sealed correctly leaving them very dirty looking (please refer to the many pictures that others have posted and you will see what I am talking about). Try to be on the top floor if available, or hope that you are below a family that puts their kids to bed (or themselves) at a decent hour. I don't care how insulated a building is, nothing stops the sound of jumping. We had a 2nd floor unit, and you could hear a lot of noise above us.The staff was OK, the check-in process is a little odd as there is no front desk area. There were 3 people sitting at desks and no one really showing people where to go. I would imagine that this would be frustrating if you were checking in at busy time.I am not sure that I would go back to this resort as there are many others that are closer and offer more amenities, but it worked for a short trip.

Called them Sunday morning as well, and let them know I called Saturday, she said she would follow up- no follow up call (""great customer service"").Other than not being able to sleep and not being taken seriously, it was a nice, spacious condo.

The pool area was great, not too deep, and the kids stayed on 1 side of the pool, no lifeguard which was also great because you don't have to hear the constant whistle every couple of seconds.If the upstairs issue would have been handled properly, I would have given it 5 stars, but this was definitely an issue for us.",2013/05/31,2013/05/01,Traveled with friends,2  ,4,2,4,0,0,4,1,3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MagdelinA_13,8,2,,,,9,7,Foodie,4,1,3,1,0,0,0,9,"Richmond, Virginia, United States",2013/05/01, 907 ,12,2019/01/02

The resort tends to be busy at weekends as can be expected, but peace is quickly restored by Monday. I have arrived at Military units with less rules to be signed for than Tuscana and can understand why this aspect has been mentioned before. The public areas are kept very clean, but I did notice that the restroom time sheets were being signed in advance with the afternoon clean being signed for by 10am, probably at the same time as the morning clean.

The resort is in a pretty good location. Close to the outlet malls and Disney. We stayed in bulding #4 which is half way between the highway and the main desk area. We didn't notice much traffic noise from the I4 in our location but I can see how it might be an issue if we were any closer to the highway. The grounds were very nice and well maintained. The 2 bedroom apartment was pretty nice wth lots of room and two seperate bathrooms with showers. Don't get me wrong, the room was clean but I would say that the carpet was a bit worn and the curtains didn't cover the windows. Instead, they had cheap looking venetian blinds. The only issue we had with our room was that the shower head broke and fell off on top of our 3 year old when he was having a bath. Staff were very nice (and sympathetic when this incident took place). The pool area was a great place to hang out and we ate 3 times at the resturant there. The food was good and reasonably priced. Drinks were cheap and the bar servers were very friendly. All amenities are located about a half a kilometer up the road...grocery store, pharmacy, resturants, liquor store. I will say that I was a little supprised at how much sound could be heard from the room upstairs. We stayed on the 3rd floor (there are 4). We could clearly hear the people above us walking around but luckly they were quiet cause we were in bed by 9:30!  Overall, a pretty nice resort close to all amenities and Disney at a resonable price. Rooms were adequate but nothing special. I would probably stay there again.",2013/05/04,2013/04/01,Traveled with family,,3,4,4,0,0,3,3,3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thebigdmb,10,3,,,,11,36,,4,6,1,0,0,0,0,11,st. john's,2006/04/01, 1146 ,18,2019/01/02

Upon going to our room (bldg. 9, rm. 9101) we loved how spacious the room was. The furniture was a little outdated &amp; uncomfortable, but I've stayed in worse. As previously noted, the curtains in the rooms don't completely cover the windows, so that was a little annoying when trying to get my little one to sleep. The pool was nice, a little dirty. We didn't eat in the restaurant any, but cooked in our own room &amp; even cooked on the outside grill one night, which was very nice. The grounds were very nice &amp; well kept.

We stayed in the Bldg. 3 on the 2nd floor (2 bedroom condo). The Pros:Condo: Plenty of space for 6 people. The condoo was immaculate. I'm a neat freak so this was really important. The couch is a sofabed. It wasn't comfortable. You can feel the metal parts of the sofabed. Mattress could have been thicker. The living room furniture is small and dated. The dining room and bedroom furniture was average but nice. The kitchen was roomy and had all the appliances including a dishwasher. There is a separate washer/dryer closet. They do no supply detergent except a sample bottle for the dishwasher and sink. The carpet in the place is dated it was a low pile shag but it was in remarkably good shape and appears clean. It looked new actually.We experienced some sweet ants in the bedroom near the front door. There were a number of them coming out from and around the bedroom window. They crawled on the bed and on me while I was in the bed. They were all over the nite stands and walls. We called the front desk and they sent someone in 10 minutes. They sprayed and we didn't have any issues after that but it was a little unnerving trying to sleep knowing they were crawling on the bed. They came the next day to make sure we weren't having the ant issues again. They demonstrated good customer service and dealt with the problem quickly which we appreciated. Keep in mind this is Florida (tropical) so it isn't so unusual to experience these pest issues from time to time.The Pool - Loved the pool. It was a very inviting pool. The pool is heated and they have a jacuzzi. The pool restuarant food was tasty and reasonably priced too. They have karoke on some nites at the pool. You can pickup free wi-fi at the pool. Unfortunately, there is no wi-fi in the rooms. The entire property is landscaped well and very clean. I enjoyed the property. Tip: Bring paper towels, toilet paper (they only supply one roll per bathroom), towels if you like thick ones. Their towels are thin and worn. Also bring your own bath soap and washing powder. Cups and paper plates if you don't feel like washing dishes all the time.",2013/04/08,2013/03/01,Traveled with family,2  ,4,4,4,0,0,4,3,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teresaw251,70,3,woman,50-64,2,16,29,,3,6,3,3,1,0,0,20,"Raleigh, North Carolina",2007/03/01, 1739 ,20,2019/01/02

The reception area was also nice and so was the pool and the bar, the food served was nice too and all the staff were very friendly. I only had one issue - I got stuck in a lift for about 2 hours until someone heard me shouting and went to get help when I was going up to my apartment, but that didnt affect my opinion on the resort as a whole. It was right near a restaurant as well as a gas station and shop, and within 20 minutes of International drive and all of the amusement parks.

I found the room to be of very poor quality, I have expressed my concerns on the comment card as well. It seemed to me that the owner's found the most economical, cheapest way to furnish a room with absolutley no regard for the guests. The room is for six, however the couch is so small and with only one addition seat available that a family of four could not possible sit and watch TV, there is only seating for three.The kitchen table as well has only seating for 4, there could easily have been two bar stools for the breakfast bar set up to accomodate more people. The linens were so poor, we had to go to our car to get additional blankets because the blankets provided were threadbare at best. The blinds were of the cheapest quality and definitely no blackout shades, so since our room was right by the street light our room was flooded all night long. And as previously reviewers have stated the TV's were awful, they were all different and no more than 19 inch, it seemed that they were randomly picked up at any old flea market.Since we were only there for two days, we tolerated it, however had I stayed a week I would have complained immediately about the condition of the rooms.I do not recommend this place for a short visit as your really must bring everything, I understand that this is not a ""hotel"" or a time share but at a bare minimum some coffee filters and some salt and pepper would be nice. You really have to bring everything as they only give you one roll of toilet paper per bathroom, no paper towels and no refreshing of towels so you must wash the ones they give you.",2013/03/18,2013/03/01,Traveled with family,3  ,2,3,1,0,0,2,2,2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FOMOwKIDS,35,5,woman,35-49,,50,43,Urban Explorer,25,9,10,4,2,0,0,50,"Toronto, Canada",2007/09/01, 5063 ,32,2019/01/02

There were several scuffs and digs all over the condo. The drains in the master bedrooms bathroom's sink and shower were slow to drain. There were bugs in the ceiling light fixtures. To top it all off we had sugar ants around the kitchen sink and dishwasher. We made the staff aware of the ants they said they would spray bleach around the sink, and have pest control in the next day. A note was left saying they were in but we continued to have sugar ants.

Here you get 3 bedrooms- kitchen, lounge area, dining area, 2 bathrooms, washing machine/dryer.Location was good. Right off the I4, on the side of championsgate.

This may sound silly, but when you're trying to get a good night's rest and are constantly awakened by the refrigerator (even with the ice maker turned off), plumbing (truly, it was like a gushing waterfall in our walls) and neighbors, it really makes a difference between a nice stay and a frustrating/tiresome one. Two other annoyances: a sliding glass door that doesn't really lock (it is operational, but so flimsy that the door can be pulled open while ""locked"" with minimal effort) and an apparent force field that prevented our cell phones/computers from getting a signal, which made the ""free Wi-Fi"" a joke.

The beds are good but I really don’t understand why they have to be Queen size when there is plenty of room for King size beds.

I saw it all.,GorgeousYVR,"I was sent down to Orlando for work for 7 weeks &amp; this is where the company put me up for that time. I was moved to 3 suites because the power was disconnected from 2. This resort is managed by Tuscana, but each unit is individually owned. When someone doesn't pay the bill- the power is cut... even if you're occupying the unit! The staff was WONDERFUL with every move. They helped me pack, dragged my luggage to the new room &amp; made sure I had everything I needed. Can't say enough about the staff.I was also there when the fire alarms went off at 4 am... then 5 am... then 6 am... not a regular occurrance. Someone had set it off. Also, please be aware that there is not staff there past a certain hour (if I remember 10 or 11pm) The main office closes at night. So if you are out late &amp; you've lost your key or demagnetize it you have to call the emergency number-- it's a HUGE hassle to get back into your room so protect those cards with your life! The units are comfy &amp; very nice. I stayed in a 2 bed/2 bath. The kitchen is great &amp; the unit feels just like home! New-ish decor with updated kitchen. Just add groceries! Everything else is provided. I was more than comfortable for those 7 weeks. My only complaint about the rooms are the wired internet in the living room... not in the bedrooms. That made it a little uncomfortable when I'd try to skype with my family back home as I had a roommate for work. I don't see this being a problem with a family.The pool is salt water... small, but luxurious! The bar has delicious sandwiches-- the best philly cheese steak short of Philly &amp; yummy drinks! We did take some time for Disney &amp; they do not have a shuttle anymore, but they can arrange one for you for $20/pp. The next time I'm in Orlando, I will stay there again with my family.

Overall, it was a good experience. The 3-BR unit we stayed in was very spacious and clean. Someone else in our group found bedbugs in their unit, asked to be moved, and while they were given a new unit, they were told by the front desk that they'd be charged a cleaning fee for the unit they vacated. I believe they worked that out with another manager; however, note that some units appear to be affected by bedbugs. The kitchen is pretty nice, granite counters, comparable to a Residence Inn. Basic kitchen tools are supplied, but the items provided vary from unit to unit. Linens and towels are provided. The pillows were surprisingly good; the towels were thin but plentiful. The pool area was pretty nice, with a bar and towels provided (note the strict towel return policy - $10 charge for towels not returned). There is a very nice movie theater you can book for free and watch your own movies or one of Tuscana's. It seats about 25 people with stadium seating and a sound system. This would be a good option for entertaining a group. Location is good - very close to a shopping center w/ big grocery store, pharmacy, nail salon, barber shop, etc., as well as very close to I-4 (exit 58). Biggest complaint would probably be the thin walls/ceilings - you could hear and feel people coming down the stairs in the public area/hallways (which are open-air) at all hours, and could really hear people walking on the floor above. You might consider requesting a 4th floor unit that overlooks the nature conservation area in Bldg 3 or 7 to avoid this (although the units are a bit darker - the sun shines on the parking lot side most of the day). Another thing to consider is that there is a wired internet connection, but no wireless unless you rent a router from the front desk (and they were sold out when we checked in). If you have a lot of people on wireless laptops and devices, you will want to be sure to request a router as soon as you check in. Wifi is just a basic amenity these days - strange that Tuscana doesn't have it. Overall, it was a good value - I think we paid around $179 a night - for a unit with lots of space where we could do our own cooking. It's not fancy or luxurious, but it's a good option for a family going to Disney and the other attractions in Orlando.

It was a great experience and the next time we go back to Disney- we will definately book another stay there.First off- it's a great community- quiet and near to a small shopping center that has a grocery store, a liquor store, a pharmacy and McDonalds and a Chili's. After we checked in at the resort and unpacked, we hit that shopping center for all the supplies we needed to the whole week. Tuscana is actually in a closed gated community. When you check in, you get your keys as well as access code to the property, which I understand changes every month for security purposes. The staff at the reception area was extremely courteous and helpful, and made recommendations on where to do our shopping. The property as a whole is clean and well maintained. The pool area was immaculate. Although we went in January, the weather was still warm enough to hit the pool 3 times that week.The condo itself was clean, comfortable and well maintained. We had a three bedroom on the 3rd floor. It was also stocked with everyting we needed to be able to cook the meals we had while there. The appliances were also very clean and in excellent condition.The resort is a 10 minute drive to the entrance of Magic Kingdom- so for us it was ideal. The resort also has a shuttle, but since we had rented a car- we really didn't make use of it.When we planned our trip, the resort wasn't on tripadvisor, I actually found it on homeaway.com and got some great rates. Not sure what the rates are through tripadvisor, so I recommend you also look on homeaway.com as well.

NoBody was logging which key was whose so anyone could have potentially entered someone else's room.

When we arrived, no waiting I might add, the resort had been hit by lighting and it had taken out the key fob entry systems and we were given keys to the condo, unfortunately the keys didn't fit but that was no problem they had taken on extra staff to get people into their rooms and I have to say they were fast, we didn't have to wait at all and we eventually got 4 key cards after 2 days. The only negative was that the jacuzzi was out of action for a week and a half, but that in no way affected our enjoyment of the resort. The whole resort and the condos were exceptionally clean and we were pleasantly surprised how big the rooms were (we stayed in a 3 bed condo, building 7), we were on the ground floor and did get a little noise from the condo above. I have to say the room we stayed in could have done with some updating but all the white goods appeared to be new, it was well appointed with cutlery, plates etc. We experienced no road noise or noise from frogs (as one reviewer commented) although we did see a few but we were on the back of a nature conservation so you expect to see some of the inhabitants. Whilst we did not eat in the restaurant we did have food from the bar, although only fast food this was very tasty and freshly made. I asked for potato chips and they were very apologetic that they had no bags of crisps they made some fresh for us - delicious! Nice big pool with a smaller separate pool for babies/children. Plenty of sunbeds and some gazebos for families with children. Pool towels were available at no extra charge you just had to ask for them and sign for them. Plenty of parking space in a secure gated complex, entering via a keycode. This is not a hotel and you will need to buy garbage bags etc and remember to put your garbage in the dumpsters and not leave it outside - just remember it's like staying in a villa. A short drive or walk away (my father-in-law did this and said it took him 10 mins max walking) down a pleasant lane you will find a publix, chinese restaurant/takeaway (which we recommend), chilli's, liquor store and a UPS store; great if you want to courier things home. It is near to the theme parks although Universal is slightly further away. There was no keysafe in our condo, not sure if this applies to all of them, and not sure if there are any safes available should you require one but we honestly didn't feel the need. No room service but you do have the opportunity to have that as an added extra, if you required it. All in all a very comfortable, secure and pleasant resort which represented good value for money. We enjoyed our holiday here and would recommend it, we would certainly stay there again.",2012/09/04,2012/08/01,Traveled with family,1  ,5,5,5,0,0,5,4,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fl0ridafan4,6,3,woman,50-64,,12,9,Like a Local,6,6,0,1,0,0,0,13,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",2009/08/01, 1319 ,15,2019/01/02

We were really pleased with our condo the only negative that we found to be: As we were on the ground floor, situated just outside the 1st bedroom was an air conditioning generator, we were fortunate enough to have another bedroom to use. The balcony also overlooked the generator which this spoilt the view, and could also be quite noisy at times, but we were not there to sit outside on the balcony we were there to go to Disney.

This could not have been a more perfect choice. We took a 2 bedroom, 2 bath condo with a sleeper sofa. The value was fantastic; the condo was neat, clean and well appointed. For those complaining about comfort items, FYI, self-catering means bring what you need for your stay or plan to go purchase when you arrive. Our condo had a roll of toilet tissue, hotel size soap, shampoo &amp; conditioner in each bath. There was a single use dishwasher soap packet and a sample size of dish soap. It got us through the first day while we figured out what we needed or wanted for the entire stay. If you stay less than 7 days you can pay for housekeeping service or use the washer/dryer in the unit. The unit had a few issues with some blinds that need to be fixed or replaced and some stains in the carpet that looked as if they tried to get them out but couldn't. You could see they had vacuumed just recently, and the distinct smell of a fresh cleaning in both bathrooms, so the place was clean, and well maintained for the use it gets.The pool area was lovely, however they do need to upgrade the cabana curtains as most of them were either torn or missing so privacy was not to be had. The outdoor bar is a nice touch, but I was a bit surprised to see 2 of the staff sitting there having a drink and then an hour later they were on duty!The welcome staff was very helpful with directions to anywhere we wanted to go, and they also had discount options as well.If you want to save on hotels &amp; dining this is the way to go.",2012/08/28,2012/06/01,Traveled with family,,4,3,4,0,0,4,4,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FLAnywhere,30,5,woman,50-64,8,79,59,Foodie,19,48,7,4,1,0,0,88,Florida,2007/12/01, 8234 ,31,2019/01/02

Did this matter to us? No!!! We're on holiday!!We couldn't find where to put the rubbish on the 2nd day so had to go back to the apartment and find the map, it's a little bit of a walk but we enjoyed the walk, it's beautiful here and at least with them being out of the way, nobody has to look at ugly dumpsters!If you want the Hilton, book the Hilton, if you want a fantastic, comfy, roomy self catering apartment in a quiet, safe location, book Tuscana Resort.",2012/08/23,2012/08/01,Traveled with family,3  ,4,4,4,1,4,4,4,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahH719,86,5,woman,35-49,39,39,21,Foodie,34,0,0,2,4,0,0,112,"Warrington, United Kingdom",2012/04/01, 6101 ,27,2019/01/02

The 7-11 and Publix supermarket are only 2 minutes away yet far enough from any hussle and bustle. The staff were pleasant and friendly. The pool was excellent (my son now has gills and webbed feet I think) with cabanas aplenty and an excellent poolside bar with food available. The apartment (block 7) was clean and spacious, yes the carpets could do with a deep clean but with the quick turnaround of guests probably not that feasible in high season. All in all I would definitely return to this resort as found it to be everything we hoped for and on speaking to other guests if there were any little issues then the staff did everything to attend to them.I work in rental property management in the UK and would say that yes some walls could do with a freshen up and as mentioned carpets could do with deep cleaning but this was just cosmetic and unavoidable in the season.Thanks Tuscana for a great holiday and hope to be back someday!",2012/08/21,2012/08/01,Traveled with family,1  ,3,4,4,0,0,4,4,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crocolog,107,4,woman,35-49,2,37,19,,29,7,1,0,0,0,0,40,Leeds,2009/06/01, 4304 ,20,2019/01/02

I guess not, because they should not want their name in the same sentence as Tuscana Resort . We took our 6 yr. old grandson on a mini vacaion before school started. We were there Sun, Mon, Tues Aug.12-15 2012. Upon entering our unit, we were met with the most digusting carpet you have ever seen.( I took pictures).When my grandson got down to play legos, I made him get up.Who knows what lurked in that carpet. The blinds were also broken in the bedrooms. I went to the front office and they moved us to a new unit. It was only slightly better, but at this point, we were tired. Again, both blinds were broken. Next morning while making toast, the toaster was starting to catch on fire. My husband quickly pulled the plug. We only got partial rolls of toilet paper for a room that is suppose to hold 6 people. No paper towels or kitchen hand towels. READ what you sign. I questioned about trash removal only because I noticed, (don't leave it outside your door).I assumed that meant leave it in kitchen for housekeeping. NO, you need to bring it to dumpster. The bags are so thin, that the trash started to fall out. I went to office to get another one. He could't find any so he emptied his trash into another one and gave me his. Even doubled, the trash was coming through. You are allowed one beach towel for pool for your entire stay. THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE!!!! STAY AWAY. The only nice thing I will say about it, is the movie theater.

When we stepped into our unit it took my breath. The first thing I noticed was that the carpet was beyond filthy. We checked in on Saturday. It was Tuesday before it was cleaned. We had to tip toe around after that because the carpet was wet from the cleaning. Why not clean the carpet before you give guests the key to the unit?The dining room chairs upholstery had food stains on the fabric. They looked awful.The kitchen had no ktichen linens.The disposal was not working.The person in our 3 couple group that slept on the twin bed fell twice in one night because the bed was broken and would not support him. They replaced the twin bed. We asked that they replace it temporarily with a queen but management refused. The twin was too small for our friend that is 6'1"" and 260 lbs. The other bedrooms were occupied and he needed a larger bed. We probably could have figured that out in the beginning but once all your things are unpacked it is tough to move to another room.We had no choice because all the three bedroom units are two queens and twins. It is not set up for three adult couples. The twin beds were not adequate. One bed was broken the other had to be repaired also.The handle on the door to the deck was broken.Our card locked us out and we had to rekey several times.There was no starter supply of detergent. The shower in the master bedroom was dirty. The ceramic had dark brown stains on the bottom. The outer edges were clean.The starter soap for the unit was one very think bar per the two bathrooms (for six different adults).There was a nest of hornets at the entrance to where we go up the steps to our unit. Many guests had to walk by the nest of hornets. I showed a maintenance worker the nest and he said he would take care of it; however, the guard hornet was still guarding the nest and I dont think maintenance did anything to the hornet nest.The hot tub at the pool area was broken all week. They tried to fix it but it was not fixed.There is no wifi service in the units, only around the pool area.The cell phone service in the area is very poor.We had to go outside the unit usually to use the phone. We were on the first floor.I can never think of a reason that I would go back to this resort.I am sure our friends will never want to travel with us again. We were there for an international church conference. This is only the second poor review that I have to offer of our travels. I am not a complainer and have ""looked over"" a lot of things in my travels. Please see our list of places traveled. It is extensive. I was suprised this unit was listed through RCI. It was not up to RCI standards.The pool area was nice. The restaurant was nice.

We were extremely pleased with the location, as it provides short commutes to the Disney area, Celebration (where we spent many of our evenings enjoying the restaurants) and several Orlando-area golf courses. The apartment was clean, well-designed (two bedrooms, two large baths, living area with adjacent large dining room, and well-appointed kitchen), and well-stocked with blankets, pillows, etc. All necessary cooking utensils/pots-n-pans, etc. were available (although we took a vacation from cooking as well). The apartment was not as sound-proof as we would have liked and there were some stains on the carpets, the only negatives. The pool is fantastic - large, clean, comfortable to swim in temperature-wise, and the attached, open-air restaurant served great food all day! The surrounding immediate area provides a grocery store, restaurants, fast-food, quick hair-cut services, etc. -- certainly everything needed for a week's stay. If you are a golfer, there are some fantastic courses in the area, including ChampionsGate (adjacent to Tuscana) and Reunion, just east, a few miles away.All-in-all, Tuscana is a perfect place to stay to enjoy an Orlando-area vacation.

The condo itself was nice, clean and spacious however, we were not told that we would have to either have our credit card debited with $300 (refundable within 28 days of departure if no breakages, damage to condo occured) or pay a $40 damage waiver fee. I opted for the latter and am quite relieved as when we walked into the condo, I pulled the blind which immediately fell from the window completely broken! The dining chairs were also quite rickety, the plates chipped and the balcony furniture wa past it's best. I dread to think how much we would have been debited had any further items broken.The biggest issue was the groups of 'young men' staying here. The pool area was quite often full of large groups of them taking up the WHOLE of the pool with either ball games or throwing each other around games. On one occasion, I reported this to reception who said that they would do something however, nothing was done and subsequentlty, a young man was thrown across the pool and he landed on my young son. I went back to reception as the blow had knocked one of his teeth loose. I was greeted with no concern at all, told to complete an incident form and given directions to the nearest hospital!! Needlless to say, we did not visit the pool again. The condo above us was also clearly occupied by a family of small elephants as the amount of noise could not have been made by anything else. Add this to the noise from the nearby highway and the large groups of men and the result is not much sleep.I would also add that these groups of men found it quite amusing to shout comments as my daugher and I walked back to our condo. We could not do anything about this as we could not tell which apartment they were shouting from. It was highly inappropriate though and the comments were not the kind of thing you would want your daughter to hear! All of the above is a shame as the resort was very convenient for the parks and there was a Publix and restaurants nearby. If you are visiting this rsort, just be prepared for these issues.I would visit Florida again, but not this resort.We had been looking forward to this holiday all year and feel very disappointed that our enjoyment of the resort was spoilt by inconsiderate guests and un caring staff.",2012/07/29,2012/07/01,Traveled with family,5  ,3,2,3,0,0,3,2,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bettyjo26,1,,,,,1,5,,,,,,,0,0,1,"Wolverhampton, United Kingdom",2012/07/01, 105 ,4,2019/01/02

Thought it was a lovely relaxing place home away from home with the added benefits of a pool. Apartments were large and comfortable and well equipped. You will need your own supply of washing up liquid, dishwasher tablets and toilet roll. this is not a problem as there is a Publix supermarket near by. They do supply a small amount of these items enough for one use. Also it might be an idea to pick up a small few supplies like tea or coffee and milk on the way as there are none at the apartments.

We are still here but refuse to stay and are paying for another place just because it is that bad. When I booked the room, I asked for a pet free non smoking room. We were given a room that had either been smoked in, or had a pet because the smell of the cleaner was so overwhelming it gave me asthma. Management at first refused to give us another room but finally did. The room we were given smells like it had been smoked in but it was better than the last one. The first room had a horrible bathroom. My daughter flushed the toilet and a bottle cap popped up. The shower was falling apart, scrapes everywhere. My husband went to check the cleanliness of the bed and when he lifted the comforter, he found the tv remote. The management is non existent, When we called to inquire about a different room, he sent up a maid with windex and room freshener. He refused to give us a refund so we could cancel our reservation. the second room we are now in had a filthy blanket that we just removed as quickly as possible. We have stayed at many condo resorts, this one doesn't provide paper towel, or coffee filters, not even salt and pepper.

The management office, however, is horrendous. Check-in was almost an hour of waiting in an un-air-conditioned office. It was very chaotic. Note that the resort caters to youth sports teams and there is no Wi-Fi. Cell service was spotty at best for all guests regardless of service provider. Also while I was there; a traveling companion was stopped by security to ask if he had witnessed vandalism that occurred during the stay and someone placed a pile of trash near a vending machine that remained for almost four days. My experience here paled to others I have had at nearby resorts. My unit (4104) was very spacious and comfortable but light bulbs were out and towels and linens were somewhat worn. The unit above is occupied by a family that lives permanently at the resort. The kids, teens or pre-teens, stay up all night playing video games. I heard yelling, screaming, stomping and objects being thrown every night; two, three o’clock in the morning. When I talked to the mom, I was told she would “try” and keep them quiet. The situation barely improved and resort management pretty much said there was nothing it could do. There are other resorts (Encantada) in the area that are more enjoyable, quieter, and less expensive .",2012/07/16,2012/07/01,Traveled with family,3  ,4,1,3,0,0,4,1,3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fromNC651,1,,,,,1,3,,,,,,,0,0,1,"Raleigh, North Carolina",2012/07/01, 103 ,4,2019/01/02

Upon returning from dinner the first evening we could not enter our unit because the locking mechanism would not work. I went to the office and received new entry cards but they did not work. I returned to the office and they said they would send someone right over. We were locked out for approx 40 min until maintenance arrived to let us in. We were told by the maintenance personel that since it was 9:00 at night some would fix it the following day. No problem. Since we were staying in for the rest of the evening this sounded reasonable. When we left the following morning we stopped at the office to check and ensure that the lock would be fixed. No one in the office knew anything about the issue but they did issue a repair order and ensured us it would be repaired. Upon returning 9 hours later, approx 6:00 pm, the mechanism STILL did not work. I again went to the office and asked about the repair. Once again no one knew anything about the issue. One of the office personnel, Jason I believe, returned with me with actual keys. None of the keys worked. He left saying he would be back. After 20 - 25 minutes of no one returning my wife went to the office, primarily because our younger children needed to use the bathroom, and to check on the progress. When she asked ""Jason"" what was going on she was told, and I quote, ""I'm sorry, you'll have to wait, I'm with another customer right now."" The person checking in also yelled at her to wait her turn. After hearing of this situation, I went to office to insist on a solution. At this point it had been 50 minutes since we returned. No one appeared to know what to do or have a solution for us. A simple, ""we are working on it and will take care of you."" would have been appropriate. in the meantime someone did show up at the unit and let my family in. The maintenance staff did finally respond that evening to work on the lock. Three people worked on the lock for the rest of the evening. They finally finished at 9:30 at night !! They were very pleasant and apologized for taking so long. This completely interfered with the plan for our evening. Our plan was to return to the unit and utilize the pool and relax since we had been out all day. We could not because of the issues. Our children were not easily consoled which just added to the frustration. Instead of relaxing and going out to dinner we sat outside the unit for close to an hour before getting in and then sitting there for the rest of the evening while the door was worked on and eating take out.We stay at many places throughout the year and I completely understand that issues arise, I would be foolish to think problems don't occur. We have encountered problems before and issues were handled adequately. However, it's the response to the problem that we encountered here that was of issue. When we are are locked out with 3 children (ages 12, 5 and 3) and after 45 - 50 minutes of waiting we are told that they are now handling other customers and we have to wait ? That is completely unacceptable !!! While the unit was very nice and the location good I would never return based on the service from the staff.

Unfortunately, we were in building 5 in a room with a ""view"" - the view was of trees, behind the trees was route 4. The traffic noise was unbearable for me, I had 5 sleepless nights. Plus, if it rained the frogs were competing with the traffic. Another teammate had a room facing the parking lot and said noise was not nearly as bad. The bedroom also did not have drapes to cover the blinds. So, if you don't mind noise and light, this could be the place for you.

It had a good washer/dryer set up, kitchen had most things and it had an Internet cable for the lap top, so handy with emails while we were away. There were some things missing though (glasses), the carpets were really stained and there were lots of extra charges they liked to threaten you with - like a mid-way clean for about $75 and if you left your rubbish at the bottom of the stairs $50 - although how they would know who it belonged to? We had to buy vim and a scourer to scrub out the shower as it was so greasy - not nice.Our queen size bed was comfy, but unfortunately there are no curtains or blackout blinds, just some white louvre blinds that do nothing to block the early morning light out - not great for light sleepers.Things were fairly quiet for our first week until a herd of buffalo moved in above us and we were treated to regular stampedes and a very irritating brat who ran from one end of the condo to the other repeatedly.Reception were not happy to do much about anything complaint-wise, including people who were smoking around the pool and not in the designated areas. During the day there was someone around, but after 9pm ish, it was an emergencies only number to dial.I hadn't realised that there was pretty much nowhere to walk to from the resort which was a bit disappointing. There's a public supermarket, a chilis diner, and a few other bits &amp; pieces but other than that, nowhere nice to amble about and catch some sun. Everywhere is a drive away, and more often than not its along a motorway.The coast is a good hour + on either side, so Busch gardens (which was brill, was about an hour &amp; a quarter) seaworld and aquatica were also fab, but thought universal parks were a bit disappointing.The pool was like a bath and appeared clean (it was June and 90-ish degrees) but usually full of screaming brats whose parents couldn't care less who the were annoying. The poolside loungers have metal arms (can you imagine how hot these get?!) and lots of the strapping is missing - wouldn't take much to fix if anyone could be bothered.Whilst some of the literature warned us about 'showers' we arrived on 2 June to be told their rainy season had started on 1 June.

El condominio en si es muy seguro, privado, con instalaciones adecuadas y espaciosas, gimnasio y la piscina-jacuzzi excelente con un resto-bar muy bueno y con precios muy razonables). La atención en el lobby es muy cordial y respetuosas. Particularmente el departamento que arrende y me asignaron, fue excelente, muy espacioso, con todos los servicios, en perfecto estado de conservacion y funcionamiento, dos dormitorios con baño privado cada uno, el living comedor muy grande y la cocina super equipada. Realmente nuy pero muy bueno el alojamiento en dicho lugar. No tengo objeciones que realizar. Compre via internet x despegar.com, y me cumplieron en todo, no tuve que pagar un solo $ adicional. Me reintegraron el deposito de u$s 300, que haces via tarjeta de credito, al retirarme. Si buscan un lugar que no sea un hotel, con espacio y ambiente fliar. para disfrutar con sus hijos, y un poco retirado del ruido cuando uno busca tranquilidad y relax luego del trajin de los parques y atracciones, les recomiendo no duden en elegir el Tuscana Resort, no se van a equivocar.

I read the reviews and dismissed some of the negative results as possible ""one time"" errors. I will say overall the resort is acceptable. Check in was smooth, room ok. Small issues with room/ condo..sink leak, horrilbe sulfur smell in master bath, mold growing due to unsealed time in master bath, broken shelf, curtain falling off, stain on carpet. I could deal with all that until .. !!! 1130pm 5/27/12, unknown guest arrives in his car and starts BLASTING HIS MUSIC FROM THE CAR WHILE HE UNLOADS, FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES!!! I try to talk to the man, he is not nice. I call the ""front desk"" and all Lisa wants to know is my name, which I won't give because I don't want to see the guy again, if my room number or name is accidentally given out. I ask for someone to contact this man and told they will. 10 minutes later nothing, I again call and Lisa gets more rude insisting on my name, I end up calling 911. AS A COP, I THINK IT IS CRAP TO BOTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH SUCH PETTY ISSUES, BUT SINCE I WAS NOT IN MY JURISDICTION AND TUSCANA OFFERED NO ASSISTANCE, I HAD NO CHOICE! I check out the next morning and the very nice, helpfull girl Jessica, says something about when you stay at hotels and there is an issue, you should always call the cops first. I explained why I wouldn't do that. I leave and after an hour discover we left two pillow....they are not worth much at all, but supposedly housekeeping can't find them. Weird since no other persons were in the room and we left it looked, it was no about the pillows, but the principle. I believe this resort has a lot of positive features, but my concern is always about integrity and hiring people who will do the right thing all the time. I don't believe you will get that here.

Nor sugar, coffee, filters, or any other minimal basics. For guests who must fly and must purchase each of these full size items for a week or less then leave it all, that's a shocker. It was supplied with enough automatic detergent for 1 use only of the dishwasher, although we were there for 4 nights. There was no WIFI at all in the rooms and even around the pool area, it only worked on our IPad or laptop if we stayed within a few feet of the lobby area.Oh, the GYM!! 90% of the equipment you see on the pictures was broken. (loose pieces of the weight cables pooled at our feet) 2 or 4 of the treadmill type machines did work.Overall, the pool area was very nice, but continually crowded &amp; noisy, due to the Groupon price special, no doubt. The employees were pleasant and courteous, but could not fix the main issue we had: the sink/shower/drain/toilet smell!!I would never stay here nor recommend it.",2012/05/17,2012/04/01,Traveled with friends,2  ,1,1,2,0,0,1,1,2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DestinMarie,46,5,,,20,87,50,Art and Architecture Lover,43,22,11,6,6,0,0,108,"Destin, Florida",2011/03/01, 9640 ,33,2019/01/02

We had restful sleeps as the beds were comfortable and nights were peaceful. The unit was clean and had all the needs of a home away from home. Our kids enjoyed their own TV’s and use of the internet in this three bedroom condo. The pool area was fantastic and we also enjoyed happy hour at the restaurant bar.

Before we went I checked to make sure it would be easy to get to the parks, and although this property is farther away than others we've patronized, it was an easy drive both to Disney and Universal. Tuscana is just off the highway easy on/off...which brings me to the other item I looked into on tripadvisor-based on other customer reviews I requested to not stay in building 6 due to highway traffic noise. We were in building 5 facing the golf course, and we didn't hear any traffic noise indoors. Sitting on our balcony was a different story, though. Traffic noise was fairly loud. The front desk staff was very helpful, responsive and friendly. They answered all of our questions, made check in/out and everything in between very easy. If I had any issues during my next stay I would not hesitate to go to them for help. They were careful to remind us that keeping our keys next to cell phones can de-magnetize them and we didn't have any problems with our keys.The bar/restaurant staff leaves something to be desired. The waitress we had told us that the bar didn't have any specialty drinks, but then the DJ doing karaoke mentioned the hotel's rum bucket. It's a crazy mixed drink with 6 different kinds of rum, pineapple juice and cranberry all in an oversized souvenir ""bucket"" cup for $11. The food is just OK (if you like Indian, don't be tempted-the naan bread is nothing like the real deal). It was so nice to have Publix right down the road! We chose Tuscana in part because we wanted to have a full kitchen so although we brought quite a few items for our meals, we did go to the store for fresh veggies and a birthday cake. This brings me to a list I'd like to share with the tripadvisor community that I wish I'd had before we went....the resort provides a ""starter pack"" of mini shampoo, mini bar soap, one pack of dishwashing detergent and a tiny liquid dishwashing soap, each trash can had only one trash bag in it, and one roll of toilet paper per bathroom (our 3 BR condo had 2 bathrooms) so if I had it to do over again I would have brought:Kitchen:Paper towelsSponge/dish scrubberDishwashing detergentDishwasher detergentSalt/Pepper/oilTrash bagsCoffee filters(A generous supply of ""the basics"" is provided in the kitchen-plenty of plates, silverware, bowls, glasses and even wine glasses-also plastic mixing bowls of varied sizes, plenty of standard sized pots/pans with lids, dish drainer, a jug for mixing juice, a few utensils including can opener and wine bottle opener, and a set of knives-they were fairly dull but useable, and our freezer had an icemaker) Our unit did not have a cutting board. I don't know if that's standard, but if you plan to do a lot of cooking, I'd recommend bringing a small one just in case.Laundry detergent/fabric softner-there is a stacking washer dryer, and the cleaning fee if you want service mid-stay is rather high so next time I would bring my own detergent and do a load of fresh towels. While we're talking about towels, I felt like I was signing my life away to borrow pool towels...next time I'll save the trouble and bring my own beach towels. Also, I had my kid diving for pennies because I didn't think to bring pool toys...OK-back to the room. For the bathroom I will make sure to take:Soap for each showerShampoo/conditioner(blow-drier is provided in each bathroom)Hand soap and lotionToilet paperTrash bagsHere's the low down on the quality of the rooms-I felt that I got a fantastic deal and was willing to overlook the minor flaws such as stains on the carpet (I felt that things were clean, and the carpet seemed clean even if it did have some discoloration) and a small tear in the sofa and a couple of drawers that didn't open/close quite right. Over all, things are nicely cleaned and I didn't have any complaints in that department. The place was huge-more than I could have asked for in terms of space in the kitchen and dining room, living room was OK space wise only because there wasn't seating for everyone in that space so if we'd wanted to watch a movie together some would need to sit on the floor/bring in chairs from dining room to sit on. Bedrooms have clock radios, closets, chest of drawers, lamps and extra blankets/sheets.The beds were comfortable, linens were provided (I wondered at one point when I was planning my trip) and in our room we had 2 twin beds in one room and the other rooms each had one queen. Living room sofa pulled out. We didn't use it so I don't know what the quality was like on that.The community is gated and generally feels very safe and friendly. Some people live here, some like us were tourists.There was plenty of parking near our building. We stayed on the 1st floor of 4 floors. There are elevators available but I didn't use them so I can't comment on the quality.The pool itself is nice, clean and well maintained. It was busy every time we went. There were plenty of chairs/lounge chairs, though it looks like it might be time to replace several of them since they're missing some slats.Over all, we really enjoyed our stay at Tuscana. If I got a good deal again (under $100 per night including the $45 cleaning fee), I would come back happily. It was easy to deal with the staff, their expectations of us were clearly laid out in the check-in packet (including info about optional fees like trash pickup outside your room for $25), it was easy to get around in the resort itself-we walked to the pool from building 5 and it was an easy walk for us. I love to be able to have space to move around in my rental, and at this price, I have stayed in lousy little hotel rooms with nothing but a mini-fridge just because it was close to Downtown Disney. Here I had a nice big closet, the ability to close my door to my bedroom, 2 bathrooms and a full kitchen.

We've been staying there every year since it opened. We have only praise for the staff and the manner in which they treat us. Everything has been in order when we arrive and if we run into any little issues they are immediately resolved. The beds are comfortable and the kitchens great to work in. The wear and tear as the years go by are somewhat expected. I think the staff do the best they can with preventive maintenance. The location works very well for us.

Upon check in they took my CC like any normal facility. I read the reviews prior to my booking so I thought it would be a good place. I travel quite a bit for work and leisure and very often to Florida. Looking at the pictures you would ""liken"" the facility to a ""Marriott"" well it is a ""poser"" at best. It poses as Marriott quality/fascade and is more like an off highway Motel and not a really good one at that. We get to our room. I ironed my clothes and hang them up. That night it was like the Royale Rumble from the WWE upstairs from our room from about 10pm to 1a.m. I tried to call the front desk but the phone did not work. Furthermore Bldg 6 is directly off the hwy and all I could hear besides the apparent hurd above me was the Highway. The next morning I called the reservation line and left a message. I did not receive a return call promptly. I went to the front desk and spoke to Debby. I advised her of what went on. I let her know we would like to be moved and I in no way blame them however, it is not relaxing orreassuring that no one was around. She stated she was not sure if she could move me and if she did I would have to pay the $40.00 additional cleaning fee. Also I may have to pay a difference. I stated that I did not find this appropriate but at this point I need to go to an off site meeting for the day and I will be available by phone. She asked if I would like to speak to a manager I told her I would like that. No manager ever called me. She called me sometime later and asked if I wanted to move to a 3 bedroom for an additional 1$0.00 a night and a $45.00 additional cleaning charge. I told herf absolutely not. She would continue to try and get me to another location. She called and left me a further message that I would be in bldg 9 which was fine and an additional cleaning fee would need to be charged. That these are provately owned and the owners should not be charged. In my opinion neither should the guests when the matter is not of thier control. The facility as a ""good"" gesture of customer service should absorb the charge. We moved to the new room. I got there and Jason called to get my CC I just literally had walked in provided him the information and hung up. Upon further inspection I noted that there was no iron or ironing board in which to re-press my clothing. Also my co-worker noted ""used"" toilet paper stuck to her bathroom door. I called left a message with no return call within an hour. I called backa dn spoke to Leo who stated that it was too late to get an iron or board and not to mention could he do anything until the morning about the toilet paper. He said he would have these items along with batteries to the remote control snet over since that did not appear to work either. About 15 min went by a maintainence worker came by with batteries and an iron. They never came by and cleaned the toliet paper or brought an ironing board. They just took my extra money and did not really care. I will NEVER stay there again. I would not reccomend it. There is also no wi-fi..

One of the two rooms rented had issues with card access. On two of the three nights, on return to the unit, none of our door keys worked. On the first occasion (first day of arrival), when our room keys didn't work, we tried to contact the hotel front desk. The room phone didn't work (didn't work the whole time we were there). We went to the front desk, but the hotel management office closes at 10 am (we had arrived back from an evening out at about 11:30 pm. The only contact was an answering service, which we had to call using one of our cell phones.Fortunately, the golfers in the room that were locked out were able to wait for hotel maintenance to arrive and replace our room keys. It took about an hour and three calls to the answering service before Michael, the hotel maintenance man, arrived. Michael was apologetic and friendly. We were told that the door lock would be re-programmed by the time we returned from golfing later the next day. Our door passes were re-programmed. Leo, the office staff member on duty, was unsympathetic, aloof and defensive, and simply pointed out that they don't staff the resort after 10 pm.When we arrived the next day after golfing, the door lock had not been repaired. Michael again apologized and made the repairs.On the third day, on returning from golfing, the door lock worked, but after an evening out, again the door keys didn't work. Michael was on duty, and replaced our keys immediately.Two other issues with the room: one room had a wireless router, but Leo told us it didn't it work, and the only wi-Fi access was at the pool area and in the resort office area.One of our group was able to fix a simple connection issue with the router to allow us internet access.While the rooms were clean and functional, the other problem was that, while the rooms had soap and toilet paper, there was barely enough to last two days, with six people shaing the two rooms. While we understood that the room supply replacements were our responsibility, to supply one soap and one toilet paper for each room is a little unreasonable (most hotels supply a minimum of two soaps, one for the sink and one for the shower).With such a basic issue as access to a hotel room which was paid for, this resort's inability to respond quickly to the problem, and then to have it recur again, is inexcusable. The rude and unresponsive hotel front desk staff member made it even worse. Only the polite and understanding maintenance person were helpful.We will not return to this resort.",2012/04/15,2012/04/01,Traveled with friends,2  ,4,2,2,0,0,3,4,3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ghaddock1,1,,,,,1,2,,,,,,,0,0,2,Oakville,2012/04/01, 122 ,3,2019/01/02

We recently booked a three bedroom villa between March 31 - April 7 2012. Being that our last stay here at Disney was spent at the Contemporary Resort within the Disney compound, we all found this resort a home away from home. The villa had plenty of space for our family and we were all extremely impressed with the convience to the Disney attractions. Epcot was less than a 15 minute drive, Universal Studios was about 25 and the airport about 35. I truly feel that as I write this, that this is a hidden gem within Orlando area. Once we stopped at The Publix and Walgeeens for a few things, the inclusion of on site bar and restaurant made us feel like not leaving. The pool area offers more than most resorts in this area by far.. very friendly staff and they even remember your name. Even the karaoke was a pleasant change of pace. The restaurant has excellent hamburgers and other finger food. The drink of choice is a resort special ""a bucket of rum"". This lovely drink includes 6 different Flavors of rum and helps sooth the nerves. The guests that we met are very pleasant as this resort does offer a very family friendly environment. I would definitely recommend this resort to my friends, family and coworkers. Thank you for the wonderful time... the sounds of music, soccer games on one of the three 55 inch Atvs in the bar, kids playing in the pool, breeze in the palm trees and the laughter from the bar will be missed.

The resort is beautiful with lush gardens and very clean. The pool was a huge hit with my kids and I was able to watch them from a cabana, deck chair, or even the lounge at Tavern at Tuscana. The Tavern has excellent food and is reasonably priced, especially after looking at the dining costs at Disney. We liked it so much, we ate there 3 of our 7 nights. We rented our unit privately from the owner of the condo (through Homeaway.com), so I can't speak to the ease of booking, but from what I could see, the staff were very helpful and attentive, even guiding us in a couple small issues we had with our unit (key code wouldn't work). It is a gated resort but I did get the feeling that people would wait outside the gate until someone would enter, then follow them in. I did not experience any problems with security or personal safety what so ever and allowed my 12 and 13 year old daughters to go to the pool by themselves, although we did have 1 of the 3 units that looked over the pool. Our unit was completely remodeled with Bamboo flooring, granite counter tops, and tiled baths. Extremely clean unit. The location was perfect! Less than a 15 min drive to Disney, Seaworld and Prime Outlets Orlando. Universal was about 30 min but I hit traffic. Nasa, Cocoa Beach, and Clearwater Beach were about 1 1/2 hour drive and worth it. I wish I could have stayed longer.I highly recommend Tuscana Resort!",2012/04/01,2012/03/01,Traveled with family,,5,4,5,0,0,5,5,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marpet1,67,,,,,2,,,,,,,,0,0,2,"Brandon, Canada",2008/08/01, 200 ,5,2019/01/02

The condo was clean, well equiped, pleanty of room, screed balcony, 2 bathrooms in the 3 bedroom, large kichen, nicely decorated. price that you pay for one night stay is equal to a double room at many hotels. However, at Tuscana you get a FULL CONDO. It was unbeleivable! The The pictures that you see at www.tuscana.net is a TRUE reflection of what you are to expect. The night was fantastic at the bar with a live DJ and plenty of happy patrons. The pool is heated and i love the zero entry level for the kids.The ONLY reason that I did not give it a 5 star is because you are self reliant once you get in the condo. No daily service and you have to restock supplies, tissue, soap ect. HOWEVER this is not uncommon for this style resorte since it is a condo and not an hotel.

We visited Universal, Orlando Science Center, LegoLand, Busch Gardens and Cocoa Beach using this our base and it took us less time to get to the attractions as we could quickly get on the I4.There is a Publix (grocery store) and gas station within 3 minutes of the resort. WalMart is about 4 miles away. You get an initial roll of toilet paper in each bathroom and one sample dishwasher soap package and you probably want to pick up some additional supplies of these on the way in.

We thought we were pushing the envelope with seven adults in a three bedroom unit, but there was plenty of room. The unit was generally spacious, although the living room area was disproportionately small. Everything was very clean but worn. The carpeting was especially scary looking, but it turned out to be stained rather than dirty. Another reviewer had mentioned that they thought the beds were full size rather than queen, and we also initially thought the beds were full size. But I measured, and sure enough they are 60 inches across – queen size. I don’t know why they look smaller. The pool area is fantastic with a nice bar and restaurant. A previous reviewer had commented that the hot tub was only warm, but it was extremely hot when we were there, and the pool temperature was pleasant. We had hoped our college age children could use the resort’s shuttle, but it only made one trip a day to Magic Kingdom, leaving the resort at 9am and returning at 5pm, so we didn’t find it useful.

We arrived mid-morning and they called to check if our room was ready - it was and we got right in - no wait! The 3 bedroom we got was a very nice size - plenty of room for everyone. The carpets were looking worn, but not unacceptably so; otherwise the room was in very good shape. The resort is sort of ""self serve"" - room service is only every 4/5 days if you stay that long (not unlike time shares). There are 4 sets of towels in each bath. Also, while there was a roll of toilet paper in each bath, there was no extra. No paper towels either (they do have dish soap, 1 dishwasher detergent and typical bath toiletries). This wasn't an issue as we were going to the grocery store anyway. Honestly, if you're going to be staying in a place like this, you'll probably have a car and will go to the grocery store anyway. I'd rather save the money on the room and bring some supplies myself. The location is rather good as well - 15 to 20 minutes to Disney World (depending on what part you're going to), 20 minutes to SeaWorld and 25 to Universal. Being off the beaten path is nice after a long day. The resort restaurant was very good, and the other amenities looked good (we didn't use the pool, etc - but they look nice!). There are not a lot of local dining venues - but Chili's does take out. Local gas prices are also very good.

The 2 bedroom/2 Bathroom layout was perfect. My wife and I had our own private space, as did my buddy and his wife. I cannot overstate how perfect the location is. It literally took us 5 minutes to get to Epcot and took my buddy and I less than 30 minutes to get to Lake Toho to fish. The resort was practically empty, which was niceWhile the pool area is fantastic but the pool itself was very cold. The Hot Tub was more like a warm tub. The bar by the pool was cool and you could enjoy a cocktail while relaxing by the pool.The accommodations themselves are about as basic as it gets. We stayed in 2403. The TV's were old and all 3 in our room would have a black box pop up after about 10 minutes, kind of like closed captioning without the words, and it would stay on until you restarted the TV and let it rest. It wasn't a huge deal because we weren't in the room much and didn't have time to watch TV. We basically used it as a jump off point for a busy 4 days. The carpets were very light in color and in desperate need of carpet cleaning. There were multiple stains throughout the room. Make sure you bring just about everything you'd need outside of the basics...coffee, filters, paper towels, etc. Each room does have basics like pots, pans, dishes but lacks other essentials. There's a 7/11 and Publix close by which helps. There are mini blinds in the room but no curtains. When that Florida sun comes up, you better be ready to get up yourself! It was a bit unpleasant after a night of drinking...I don’t want this review to come off as complaining, because we left very pleased with what we got for our money. We'd definitely return to the Tuscana again.

Upon arrival to Tuscana we wer pleased with the check in procedure. Our condo was nice and clean but the patio door lock was broken and a gentle push would give you access to the condo. We complained about this and a maintenance man was sent out to fix it. After checking the door would now lock we discovered that it didn't and again a push was all you had to do to open it. We complained again and it was eventually fixed. Another problem we had was with the toaster which was dangerous due to the heating element was snapped in the middle. This meant any bread would not toast and immediately burn setting off the smoke alarm. We asked 5 times for this to be replaced and this never happend we were left with it. The location of this resort is excellent for Disney however you are limited to only a couple of restaurants nearby. The restaurant/poolside bar serves lovely food and we totally intended to use it often but on our first visit we were very disappointed with how they calculated our bill. There was a party of 10 and we all sat together there was no mention of any service charge being added to the bill, it was not displayed on the menu so we expected to be charged for the food only and make our own decision to how much tip we paid. When we each got our individual bills there was no breakdown and the total amount far exceded the cost of the food. We queried this and was told that a service charge had already been added. Then we got a frosty attitude from the staff who also said they dont normally do this then why do it to us? We paid up but we should have requested a full breakdown so we knew exactly how much the service was. This spoilt what had been a good night for us all and we never used the restaurant or bar again. So watch out if dining here we never had a problem with any other restaurant in orlando and always left a good tip of about 20%.",2011/12/14,2011/11/01,Traveled with family,1  ,4,2,4,0,0,3,4,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulW915,41,2,man,35-49,,7,5,,1,3,2,1,0,0,0,7,"Billingham, United Kingdom",2011/12/01, 725 ,10,2019/01/02

The resort was within 10 - 15 minutes drive from the theme parks but as far as I'm aware there are shuttle buses available from reception daily. Within walking distance there was a supermarket, pharmacy, gas station, a typical American restaurant, pizza restaurant, etc. The resort itself was immaculate &amp; our apartment shocked us - as it was so large and welcoming. Its standards of cleanliness was top class and our bed was extremely comfortable. They are very well equipped: a huge (and powerful) microwave, huge oven, huge fridge-freezer, dishwasher, washing machine, tumble dryer &amp; a TV with so many channels my husband and I found it hard to chose. There is also the option to hire DVDs from reception. There was a fee for house keeping (which is a little strange &amp; there is also a call out fee if the toilet gets blocked from anything other than toilet paper, we also found that odd but didn't take too much notice, as we put it down to families in the past, blocking toilets with all sorts of unknown objects)There is a restaurant &amp; bar-tavern (as its called) within the main building ran by English people, on our second day we had lunch there (recommended by a very friendly receptionist), it was very reasonably priced and extremely tasty, something to suit everyone. There is also a small convenience store (very reasonably priced, $1 for a black coffee). The pool area is very well maintained with several lounge-deck chairs, and tables and chairs with parasols for those who chose to stay in the shade. The kiddies poor has a large mushroom waterfall and is in a gated area, very safe for any child but particularly safe for curious kids like my son. Staff were so inviting &amp; helpful from the booking stage to the end of out stay.As our holiday came to an end, I for some silly reason thought we were checking out a day later &amp; when I returned to my apartment, the key-card would no longer work. I walked to reception to explain my situation and when they informed me that my check out day was that day I was obviously distraught with the notion of having to pack immediately and drive to our friends (3 hours away) 1 day earlier than scheduled. One of the managers met with me and told me that it was going to be absolutely no problem what so ever. I was obviously relieved and she offered me either a late check out or an additional night stay - to say the least it took the stress away!!! I just wanted to post this review, because before I booked with Tuscans I spotted one or two negative reviews which nearly turned me off the place. Let me assure you, I am a very very well travelled person, both me &amp; my husband work for an Irish air line, meaning we travel all the time and stay in many hotels &amp; resorts.Tuscans would rank very highly in our estimation and as soon as I arrived home, I immediately told friends and family of our wonderful experience there. We will most definitely be returning there in the future, hopefully we will bring more family the next time, as I beleive it suits all ages &amp; I'm sure my parents would have an equally great experience. It is the perfect destination for families intending to visit the theme parks, or those planning a shopping trip to the very close by outlet centres (also excellent value for money). Please dint take any notice to the negative reviews, as I was there and experienced the resort, and I can now understand why there are so so so many positive reviews.",2011/12/13,2011/12/01,Traveled with family,4  ,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alocindownes,12,3,,,,16,22,Like a Local,7,7,2,0,0,0,0,16,"Dublin, Ireland",2011/06/01, 1622 ,14,2019/01/02

The apartments are well kitted out and have everything you need to make your stay comfortable however you will need a trip to the Publix's supermarket at the end of the road to the resort as you will need some of the basic's like kitchen roll washing powder salt &amp; pepper (if you use them). One thing to note is that the kitchen sink is fitted with a waste compactor so you don't through food out in the rubish you just turn on the water and put the food down the waste compactor use a spoon to push it down gently if necessary (not to far) just past the rubber cover. Switch onthe compactor, the switch is over on the far right from the sink make sure you switch off when finished compacting the waste food. (with the heat food can smell very quickly if you throw it into the dumpsters all attracts animals like racoons etc.I am only home and already looking forward to going back next year.",2011/12/11,2011/12/01,Traveled with friends,3  ,5,4,5,0,0,5,4,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertB164,8,3,man,,23,11,9,,8,5,0,1,0,0,0,37,"Belfast, United Kingdom",2011/12/01, 2104 ,20,2019/01/02

My carrier is AT&amp;T, so other companies may have better signal strength probably?The resort provide washer/dryer, but they don't provide laundry detergent. There's a publix 2min away, so you should be able to get it from there. Other than these small issue, the resort is pretty good. There is a golf course right at the back of the resort (directly in front of building 4,5,6), i am not sure which course is it but I think its from the Reunion resort course. So you can just bring your clubs and walk directly into the course (when theres nobody around!) and play 2 holes (a par4 and par3) over and over again if you want :) shhhhhh Overall, this resort is decent for the price, and it's close to Disney and various attractions.

But quality was fairly robust, carpets were a bit dodgy in places; tube TVs which is a bit old fashioned but worked OK. It was clean. However it smelt when you first went in - due to the air-con. Again a standard issue but once you realised that it was fine. One sofa - sat 3 at a squash, plus one chair. For a party of 5 not ideal but worse if you had more in there; sofa not very comfortable; old fashioned style over comfort.Big fridge / ice maker. Kettle and all other standard electric kitchen items. Plenty of sockets; Microwave and full oven / hob. Dishwasher - took a looooong time.Washer / Dryer combo did the job although the Dryer was not as efficient as I would have liked. Showers powerful and no water loss issues (but we were on ground floor). Bath in communal bathroom.Walls quite thin. Floors / ceilings seemed more solid.Parking plentiful, communal areas clean, excellent pool, open late. Pool towels and plenty of sunbeds and canvas cabanas. Extremely hot jacuzzi.

On a previous visit to Orlando we had a lovely villa out at Davenport Lakes, but it was just too far away from the main attractions, and although we had a pool there, it wasn't heated, so was ultimately useless to us in Feb anyway!We decided that the Tuscana would be a better option since it is all apartments, but we were concerned we'd have little room, and none of the luxuries of a villa holiday - this couldn't have been more wrong, there was plenty of space for the 4 of us (2 adults/2 kids) and it was well equipped for our needs. It's placement on the i4 means you are very close to the attractions of Seaworld/Universal etc, and equally not too far from Disney parks. The on site bar and restaurant was great for occasions where we just wanted an easy meal, or a day relaxing by the pool. Staff were great - the chef was a star, and always seemed to enjoy a chat whilst he prepared your food as you wanted it. The pub/bar part of the resort is run by an English couple who were very nice, and had some useful tips for places to go and see etc.The pool here was heated, although we seemed to have chosen one of the coldest spells in Floridian history for a holiday in 2010!!, and spent most of our time wearing hoodies and jeans rather than shorts and tees like on our previous visit at this time of year! :]The resort is located in a nice spot with lots of trees in and around the different apartment blocks, including a good few orange trees, and there is often wildlife to be seen around the site. My daughter and I were walking back from the restaurant one evening with take out, and came face to face with a Raccoon in the groundfloor hallway which opens out to the woods at the back.

We stayed at the Tuscana Resort for a baseball tournament we were playing in Orlando. Though the room was very large -- and very clean -- it was in desperate need of Upgrading.First of all, both bedrooms contained ""full size"" beds -- not even Queens -- we rarely stay any place without a King bed in at least the Master Bedroom. Second, no WIFI in the rooms, which made it difficult for me to take care of business as needed. There were no ceiling fans in the bedrooms -- another amenity that is almost 100% guaranteed in any resort in Florida these days. All rooms had T.V.'s but no flat screens. Entire condo (except kitchen and bathrooms) was old, worn out carpet -- clean but old and worn out. Our coffee pot didn't work. The condo advertised it slept six -- but only if you are ok with 2 each in ""full size"" beds and 2 in a sleeper sofa that was even smaller than the beds. The family room only held about three people comfortably (very very small). Finally, the walls are so thin, I could hear the T.V. in the room next to us, and it sounded like the people above us were about to come through the ceiling!The staff was very very nice. The location and surrounding area were wonderful. And the Pool area was nice, big, and clean -- the kids spent all three days in the pool and loved it. The only reason I can only give an Average rating is because, based on my experiences, the amenities in the condos just don't measure up to ""very good"" or ""excellent.""",2011/10/24,2011/10/01,Traveled with family,,4,4,5,0,0,3,2,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JLOFamilyTravels,2,,,,,1,,,,,,,,0,0,1,"Tampa, Florida",2011/10/01, 100 ,3,2019/01/02

It was a fantastic holiday from start to finish and the Tuscana was perfect as a base to get to all of the attractions. You are less than 30 minutes away from most of the Parks but a respectable distance away to feel you have some rest time from all the activities happening in Florida.The Tuscana are seperate condos - we were in room 4107 - and these condos are spacious and clean and have all the mod cons. Towels were provided. There was a washing machine &amp; dryer tidied away in a cupboard within the condo which meant washing/drying could all be done before we returned home. That in itself lightens the load when you none of that to do on return from holiday!The pool there was a good size. I went for a swim every morning at 8 a.m. and had it to myself. Bliss &amp; suprisingly warm, even at that time. The children had a swim most days on return from seeing all the Disney shows/attractions and it wasn't too deep.  The Tuscana is minutes away from a 24/7 &amp; a Publix supermarket, Subway, a Mc Donalds &amp; one of the pizza eateries which we never visited. Everything is quick, convenient and easy to get to.The Tuscana was the icing on the cake on this holiday. It was peaceful, pretty, clean and the staff were very pleasant and co-operative. The location couldn't have been better and we know this resort suited us much more than any of the Disney themed hotels. You can have TOO much of Mickey and his mates....Thanks for a brilliant stay. We have already recommended you to others as a holiday base and we will book here if/when we return when the children are a bit older.Great holiday and it softened the blow of turning 40yrs old while we there ;-)",2011/10/22,2011/10/01,Traveled with family,,4,4,5,0,0,4,5,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaneSarah37,12,3,woman,35-49,2,13,4,History Buff,8,4,0,1,0,0,0,15,England,2008/05/01, 1409 ,14,2019/01/02

I emailed the resort beforehand and requested a quiet condo away from the road so we were put in condo 9, and recd room 9408. It was huge in size, spotlessly clean and extremely quiet. There are three double bedrooms in this room, two bathrooms a livingroom, dining room and kitchen. The facilities are fantastic and in fact we all felt glum leaving the condo knowing we were going back home to much smaller homes and facilities...When we arrived we were offered to pay either $300 deposit which would get back on check out or pay $39 fee so you wouldn't have to wait for your deposit back so we paid the $39. This was a small price to pay for the extremely clean condo we received.The pool area is lovely and clean and we saw the pool getting cleaned regularly. It was never busy when we were their as I think mostly families travel here and spend their days at the park.I have one small problem overall. The bar and restaurant are not owned by Tuscana, they are owned by an English couple. the husband of which I found quite hostile and unfriendly. i am 27 and I was regularly asked for ID despite ordering drinks their daily. We were unaware that in Florida for food/drink orders at the table you must tip at least 18%. Well we are from Scotland and so a 10% tip is generous, so we tipped 10% even although the staff did no extra work for this, we got the drinks ourselves and she had no smile on her face but we thought we would tip to be fair anyway, however the waitress came over and asked us for more money, we were all in shock and decided to not eat their again.We travelled a lot within our two weeks stay, there really is not a lot of places to go locally, you have a supermarket, pharmacy and a chilis (which was great and cheap).

That's what you get with this resort. Me and my family have just returned from Florida where we stayed at the Tuscana resort with me, my sister and five children between us includng a baby. I am a very fussy person for hygiene so I was very impressed when I placed my key in the door and was presented with a very spotless condo. Despite other reviews about this place being very dirty we found that this was not the case and this was not just in our condo we found the whole place from the pool, to the restaurant, to the toilets to be of a very high standard. The condo itself was very well equipped with all mod cons in fantastic condition, it was very spacious and had a television in every room which is great when you have as many children as we had. We found that the location was in great proximity to Disney, Publix, Outlets with the furthest park being Universal but still not that far away and if you don't want to drive to Disney then they have a free shuttle service that is from 9 thru to a 5pm pick up. This wonderful service is provided by the lovely Issac, who drives the nicely decorated and A/C'd minibus, which meant that we didin't have the hassle of driving ourselves and you save the $14 parking fee. We also encountered other wonderful people during our stay like, Karen at the front desk who could have not been more helpful with all things Orlando and Tuscana related, aswell as Jenny at the restaurant who was just so helpful and accomodating. Also to all the other staff who we can't mention by name as we didn't know it but who were also friendly, helpful and polite. We had 2 maintenence issues when we were there to do with the condo and they were dealt with very promptly with a nice note left behind. My children were also always safe enough to use the pool by themselves and walk around safely aswell as enjoying the lovely range of wildlife that we saw. I would definately reccommend Tuscana to others and would say to the sceptical ones out there to not believe in everything you read as Tuscana is a wonderful quiet and peaceful resort in a good location ( which is amazing as it is very close to the I4 expressway) and we would definately go back and I have started to tell friends about it already.

Far enough away to be a little haven of tranquillity, yet only a 15 minute drive from all the fun of Disney, Seaworld etc. Situated in Championsgate it is a quiet location but only a few minutes away from some convenience stores and a gas station. The appartments are ideal for families with either two or three bedrooms on offer. On arrival we were upgraded to a three bedroom appartment at no additional cost. Everything was spotlessly clean and it was great to be able to spread out (which you can't do in an Hotel) and watch television after a long hard day at the attractions or just chill out. There is a nice pool on site and a restaurant where you can get a very reasonably priced and enjoyable meal. And the beauty of it all is the price to stay at the resort - compared to most of the Hotels closer to Disney in Orlando, it is a real bargain.

The Tuscana is an excellent place to stay whilst being on holiday in central Florida. We had a three bedroom Condo as there were seven of us; six adults and a two year old child. The Condo was very spacious with everything you need, first room had a double bed was very spacious and had en-suite bathroom, second room had a double bed and was also very spacious, third room had two single beds and again very spacious, all rooms had plenty of room for storeage, e.g. cupboards, drawers, hangers etc. As well as the room with the en-suite bathroom there was another bathroom with a bath and shower plus basin and WC. The Condo also had a washing machine and dryer, microwave, cooker, sink, plenty of dishes and glasses. There is a table in the livingroom area with six chairs around it. There is a TV set in the livingroom with a DVD player and a TV in each of the bedrooms. There is also an iron and ironing board and a hair dryer. We were on the fourth floor of building number two (we requested that room and building a couple of months before arriving and they managed to accommodate our request) there is a lift in each building and although the Resort was full during our stay we never once waited any length of time for the lift. There is a small gym at the Resort which we used a couple of times, there are a couple of excersise bikes, three treadmills, a couple of cross-trainers and an all purpose resistance machine, the gym has a couple of TVs for you to watch while you train and a cold water dispenser. There is a small movie theatre in resort which to be honest we didn't see, (too much to do in Florida rather than sit in a movie theatre) there is a small shop on site, the pool area is beautiful with a lovely hot jaccuzi aside from the main pool, there are small private Cabanas around the pool. We didn't have to deal with the reception much, but anyone we spoke with was very pleasant and helpful, because there were seven of us we felt we may not have enough towels, we mentioned this to reception and they arranged for us to have some more. We didn't use the on-site restaurant, so can't comment on that. In the Championes Gate area there are some handy shops and eateries near the Tuscana, Chillis and McDonalds, a Walgreens chemist a Publix Supermarket and a Garage selling fuel. Any complaint or moan that you may read or hear about this Resort is, in my/our opinion unjust, I had read some reports about noise coming from the clubhouse and other negative things were said, yes there is a karaoke in the clubhouse, but once inside your Condo you can't hear any noise, my two year old grand-daughter is a light sleeper and she wasn't disturbed by anything, so don't let that put you off. All that said and done, we do have one complaint which is a very small issue and was dealt with by reception staff as soon as approached; the key card to access the Condo sometimes didn't work right away, but once reception staff re-programmed the cards it was fine.

My daughter and her husband found what look like a tick on her bed that night. Tuesday morning the resorts regular quarterly bed bug check was conducted. There was not information about this; the pest inspection said that a letter was supposed to be sent. He and his dog didn't find any bugs until I mentioned about the tick looking bug. He then goes back into my daughters room and finds bed bugs behind the headboard of the bed. He tells us we have to move and get clothes for 2 days and come back then. First I must run the clothes and stuff I take out of the room through one complete cycle of the dryer. I go to talk to Management, Robert Jimenez, General Manager. He assured me that they would work on a plan for my family. We were told we could only take a couple of days of clothing and they would assist us in moving to another room. We would be there for 2 days and then move back. Jimenez said that whatever the pest control guy said that would be what they would do. I am thinking who is in charge.  I went back to our room #5307 and waited. Someone from house keeping met me at my room and brought me my keys. I asked where our new room was she said, ""in the next tower."" I asked is it in this building? Very hateful saying, ""the next tower!"" then she left. We had to run our 2 days of clothes through the dryer and move ourselves and find the next room. I went and talked to Mr Jimenez once again, he apologized for his house keeper and stated this is all new to the resort this has never happened before. He said they are planning on comping me 2 days but he would get back with me to discuss what the resort was going to do. Friday came and time for us to move back in and get the rest of our stuff. I go back to the room #5307 and talk with the pest people and they tell us we can't move back into this room. I asked about all of our stuff and the pest control stated that everything had to be treated again. I told them that I am on vacation and I could not sped the day playing this game. House keeping said they would bring it to our room when it was all completed. Not happy but I said Ok. I came back that afternoon and had to go find our stuff. I went to the office to talk to them and no information about our situation was passed down. I told the young woman at the desk to call Mr. Jimenez That I wanted to talk to him. She said that she would and he never has tried to get back in touch with me since.I understand that things happen but due to poor management and leadership made a bad trip terrible. I lost a few hundred dollars in food and lots of time that cant be replaced for me and my family at the parks.

Our kids loved the pool, and I felt it was very nicely designed. The location is fantastic. You're only 15 minutes from Disney World, and there's no traffic to fight. The resort has an on-site restaurant, which to my surprise was very good. My only complaint is that the insulation between floors is very thin. We had a herd of buffalo staying above us and could hear every move they made. I would request a room on the top floor if you plan to stay here.

The resort grounds are beautifully maintained and the condos are large and spacious. My only complaint in this regard, would be that the Resort Management update the T.V.s to flat screen versions as the ones included in the condos are old and outdated including some of the carpeting which had a stain outside the bathroom hallway. Also I would replace or update the couches and chairs in the living room as there was only comfortable seating for 3 and we were 4 people. Otherwise our stay was marvelous and very relaxing. Pool area is large and has that resort feel and look. It was great. Close to the interstate 4 to travel to Orlando and the Theme Parks 20 minutes maximum and groceries and pharmacy were close by 5 minutes from resort as well as restaurants.

The pro's of this resortHandy for Disney - 15 - 20 minutes to Magic Kingdom with no traffic at anytime of day.Pool Area - During the day it was quite nice and clean.Gardens and Building Exterior - Well maintained.The con's of this resortReceptionist - On check in was quite rude (short), which after 9 hours of travelling is not really what you want. Rooms - The rooms are nice, but you can tell they have be well used, again compared to other resorts in Orlando I feel let down.Noise - You can hear every noise that the room above and below makes, Imagine living in a room below a heard of elephants, seriously we heard booming footsteps from above until 1am and then starting again at 7am most days/nights.The rubbish pickup truck comes at 4am and sounds like being on an F1 track.Out of Hours Service - When the reception shuts, you are diverted through to an answering service who gave the impression of not being bothered, we rang up one night to complain about the noise and we were told ""Don't worry we will contact them immediately"" Rang back 30 minutes later to be told it will be done in a minute and they asked for our telephone number which isn't listed on the phone or in the house file, we then asked how they would contact the room above if they dont know the room phone numbers and the person on the end of the phone got quite rude and ended the call. So we had to put up with continuous noise from the joined apartments for 2 weeks. Pool area - Used the bar on evening and got bit to hell, we now call this mosquito alleyAs the title says you only get what you pay for, if you want a 2** budget holiday then this is for you If you are looking for anything above that rating try Vista Cay or Sheraton Vistana, you pay a bit more but it's well worth it.

I have never been to Orlando, but this place has soured my entire view of the area. We checked in and it seemed okay. I put my electronic key in the door and it didn't work. I went to the front desk and it took over thirty minutes to get someone there to help us. We were standing outside for more than thirty minutes in 95 degree heat with a three month old. The inside appeared okay at first. The carpet had absolutely disgusting stains on it as well as a few bugs. The bugs were not big, but it is still the principle. We were traveling with a three month old and they said they were going to put a pack &amp; play in our room. On multiple occasions I went to the office to ask about it and I kept getting excuses why it was not there or I was told a couple of times it was on the way. We were eventually called FIVE hours later and told they didn't have one and they would have one there in the morning. It would have nice to know before ten o'clock when all the stores were closing or closed. The bathtub had a foot of water in it and the first thing you see when you pull in is a broken down Colwell Banker truck with a flat tire doing their advertisements. The entire complex was filthy and I would not suggest renting from this facility. They were very deceptive on many matters and they claim to be close to the Orlando area. It is probably at least a twenty minute highway drive to anywhere. Had I known I would have looked for a condo on International Avenue (Close to everything). I have attached pictures to show how filthy this place is. In the front office I talked to the ""Head of House Keeping"" who told me all of the problems were on someone else and had only more excuses for the bugs and not ever bringing the pack &amp; play they promised for my three month old son. She simply wanted to say ""have a nice day"" in a sarcastic manner. YOU WOULD BE A FOOL TO RENT FROM THIS PLACE. Pictures are very deceiving so I am posting some real pictures. The massage therapist who is at the pool got excellent reviews from my wife and mother-in-law though. She has no affiliation with the actual facility though. I also forgot to mention there were holes in our doors.

The pool area is currently beseiged by mating flys. They don't bite but are annoying. I assume this is seasonal and seemed to vary day on day, hour by hour.2. The carpets in our appartment were bleach stained but clean. I noticed new carpets going in around the complex so assume the manangement are onto it.3. There is no inventory for the items in the appartment which means you have no idea what you should have nor does the management know whats been damaged or lost.4. Despite the previous management response regarding the tavern staff tying their hair back. I can confirm femaile staff are still not tying back their hair when serving food. The foods great though especially the hand cooked crisps and wings.5. Some reception staff could be less than helpful at times. Think New York attitude and add some. Seemed more interested in answering the 'phone than finishing a conversation.6. The spar service is hit and miss. Tried on several occasions to get a manacure and finally gave up. When someone was in attendance it was the wrong person; however she said she'd make an appointment for one hours time. After having her lunch she shut up shop and left without confirming what was happening despite us only sitting 5 yards away.7. Condos are huge and well equipment apart from limited space in the lounge area for more than 4 people at any one time and no tea towels provided which should be standard.8. Close to the 192, Orlando and Disney. Distance is relative, the same jouney in the UK would take for ever but not in Florida.9. Great access to I4.10. Neaby Publix has everything you need and is cheap.11. Nearby Chillis is good.All the above comments are minor and on the whole this is a great place and we hope to go back. I certainly would recommend to others.

The 6 person unit was clean with generous amounts of room in a villa setting having pretty much everything that we needed in the unit. We have stayed in Orlando before in 1998 &amp; 2002 and found that this was the best resort we have stayed in while visiting. Our children loved the pools when we came back from a day of seeing the theme parks. The staff &amp; housekeeping were very polite and eager to care for us. Everything was close by for groceries &amp; outlet shopping. Busch Gardens, Kennedy Space Center, and Daytona Beach were all great for day trips. We will surely stay here again as this resort offers excellent high quality amenities for a great value for an amazing price. I found the 4 day 3 night Disney package on Orlandoparkvacation. I have stayed at some top quality hotels and resorts and this definitely rank right up there with the best. My kids and wife love that it is a secure community giving it a comfortable worry free experience. They did leave the light on by the entrance of the villa for security and safety as it is dark with all the trees on the property. Everything inside the unit was clean and well maintained.

There was plenty of room to move around but like others have said the carpets were stained and really need to be replaced. The dining room chairs could use a good cleaning or have them recovered due to stains. The living room does lack furniture. It has one small sofa and a chair. Our daughter would only sit in the middle on the sofa as she said the rest of it was uncomfortable. I ended sitting in the chair if I even bothered to sit in the living room as the rest of the family sat on the sofa. The kitchen was nice. We did have to ask 3 times to get a frying pan though as all we had was 3 pots to cook in. There were no small coffee spoons in the cutlery tray -- only dessert spoons which barely fit into the single serve yogurt cups. Also, there are no pot holders/oven mitts for taking baking trays out of the oven. Also there was only 1 stained dish towel and no dishcloth for doing dishes. Liquid dish soap is supplied but only 1 small package of dishwasher soap.The pillows are not very comfortable to sleep on. They are thick foam about 2-3"" thick. The bed sheet barely covers the bed so if you sleep on or near the edge, don't expect to have any covers. The blinds do not darken the room so the outside lights keep the room ""light"". I don't think there is any kind of sound proofing at all. The tenants above us sounded like a ""herd of elephants"" when they come home every night waking all of us up. We called the front desk and asked if we could change rooms due to the noise but as they were fully booked they said they would place a courtesy call asking them to try and be quiet. That only lasted only 1 day. The third day of our stay they did their laundry at 11pm &amp; I could have swore that I was sleeping in their laundry room it was so loud.

We refused to stay in that condo and after a lot of huffing and puffing were allocated another one. This was marginally better, but there were holes in the doors/walls, The carpets were still dirty (although not as bad) The screen around the terrace was filthy. The chairs and settee were dirty. However the bedding was clean but we had to wash all the towels before using them as they were stained...... The pool area was nice and the snack bar/bar staff were friendly. We have stayed in Florida approx 10 times now in hotels and villas and this is by far the worst place we have stayed.

The carpets are filthy, filthy dirty. The living room furniture consists of a 2-seater sofa and one tiny, uncomfortable filthy dirty chair. Dining room furniture was filthy as well. They allow animals so we listened to dogs barking outside all night long. They advertise this property as a ""gated community"" which is just a joke; there is no one on staff after say 11 p.m. until morning so if you have any issues, no one could get there for at least a half hour. We had a problem one morning with water pouring in through the ceiling vent of the master bath, called the front desk, only to get an answering service who asked for our address and wanted to know, after we explained that water was pouring in through the vent, if this was an emergency or if it could wait until someone came in. (Someone overflowed the toilet above us....thank goodness we were there at the time or it would have been an even bigger mess). We were never to happy to pack our bags and get out of there. If you like a clean place to sleep, you want to look somewhere else. We have been renting in the Orlando area for 4 years now and this was our worst experience by far. It does have a nice pool area and snack bar; however, be very careful if you order a drink and it spills accidentally because the male bartender will definitely let you know he is not going to refill your glass; it was your fault that when you slid your glass across their counter, it had a ridge in it which tipped it over!!

When I arrived at the resort I was quickly checked in with a security card which is needed for the door and access to the pool area. I arrived to find a very spacious room which was much more than I expected. There was a balcony overlooking the golf course so we had a great view. The rooms were all spotlessly clean as was the entire resort, everywhere was spotless and I witnessed resort staff constantly sweeping up and cleaning around the grounds. I found the kitchen to be equipped with everything you could want although I did not cook myself and choose to eat at the tavern in the resort or other nearby locations. Bathrooms and bedrooms had adequate towels and bed linen and the storage space was great – a huge walk in wardrobe. We didn’t have a car when we stay at the resort so we were a bit limited even without this we still managed to visit Magic Kingdom on the courtesy bus to and from the resort. Another day we went Universal Studios which was really close by. Another evening we went to Downtown Disney and also a bus tour to Kennedy Space Centre. The week I stayed the resort was very busy with lots of families and couples. It seems to cater for everyone. I spent a lot of time by the pool which was lovely. The weather was great so it was lovely to lie in the sun. The pool area was very clean and there was always people swimming even late at night. There was a separate kids pool area also. The tavern is right beside so it was handy for getting drinks, ice-cream and food.There is a long drive way into the resort and if you are walking it will take about 15mins to get to the closest shop, note this drive is not lit up at night time. We walked every day to the shop to get water, snacks etc. it would be great if the resort could provide a small shop that sold all of these supplies that you might need for a stay there.I did enjoy my stay in Tuscana. It’s a quieter resort away from all the noise of some of the other areas.

Driving up to the gate and seeing beautiful decor just took my breath away! It was sooo tranquil with the sound of that gorgeous water fountain! It was a paradise!  CONDO: We Went to our condo which was very accessible with the key in a code pad just outside the door! The condo was very clean and spacious! We have stayed at many other places in Orlando but this place will be our return place from now on! The two bedrooms were beautiful with tons of space to lay your suitcases down. The bathroomS are huge! A great space for bathing three kids and changing them. The kitchen was great; very clean and loaded with the necessary items! The patio was also a perfect little getaway to go sit with your morning coffee!  POOL: The pool area is just stunning! The Italian /Mediterranean theme felt so classy.The children were amazed with the size of the pool! We couldn't get them out, which made it easier to relax! The hot tub was very clean, hot and relaxing!My father loved the cabanas. THE RESTAURANT: The restaurant had the best food. The kids loved eating poolside! The pizza and wings and fries was great! The restaurant staff are fabulous people! We met people, poolside, from all over the world, overseas, Canada and different states! We enjoyed the wireless internet poolside as well. It was very quiet at night. The resort is groomed beautifully and kept up . Every day you would see someone mowing the lawn or someone else picking up scattered things around the grounds. I love the big yellow blooming trees! The resort felt sooo SAFE, even at night which was important having three children.  LOCATION: The area surrounding Tuscana had everything you would need! Publix supermarket was a great place to shop. We also went to Chillies Restaurant, McDonald's,The hair Cuttery ect... which were practically next door to the resort. DISNEY: It is a perfect location for any of the parks in Orlando. Tuscana is Very close to Disney! I have posted vacation pictures on my facebook page and everyone is inquiring about this beautiful resort!

No high pressure sales, etc. When my family and I went right before Christmas,2010, I booked it through a 3rd party website online at a discount rate w/ 2 Disney tickets thrown in. We did have to sit through a 90 minute tour ......at a totally different resort (Wyndham). Tuscana had/has nothing to do with that. It wasn't even mentioned at check-in and I'm assuming they didn't even know. My assumption is the previous reviewer may have did the same since his review just doesn't make sense. We also had a very nice 2 bedroom/ 2 bath and based on 99% of the other reviews, that is the norm here. They also allowed us to check in at 12:00PM since we arrived early. I normally wouldn't post reviews but felt compelled after hearing about this on Facebook (I get resort updates since I added them to my ""like"" list.) I suggest you do the same if staying here. To verify I'm legit, browse their wall from October/Nov and you'll see some questions I asked them....it's under Anthony Ca__ara.",2011/03/14,2010/12/01,Traveled with family,,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnthonyC1969,7,3,,,,12,8,,6,5,0,1,0,0,0,12,"East Islip, New York",2010/05/01, 1208 ,12,2019/01/02

I was not thrilled when I noticed both bedrooms had double beds. My husband and I don't fit in a double bed comfortably. There were no blankets on the beds, and only 2 blankets in the closet although it says sleeps 6. Only 4 chairs at the table, when the condo sleeps 6. The wall to wall rug in the unit was stained and should have been changed years ago. In the kitchen there was no sponge, no papertowels, no pasta strainer, no pot holders, no bottle opener. I was told by housekeeping that a pasta strainer and bottle opener would be brought to my room but that didn't happen until I asked again the next day. How could they not supple a pot holder if you are expected to cook? There was no list from housekeeping of what is suppose to be supplied in the kitchen area. The units are privately owned and privately rented out. The unit above the one I rented, must have had many people, there were people coming and going all day and night, banging and loud talking at all hours.

After my recent experience at Tuscana Resort in Orlando, Florida , it can be! Being fortunate to extend this years family vacation, a friend suggested Tuscana Resort , advice that I shouldn't have taken. Booking online the first week in January for the last week of February I found what seemed to be a great three night price but required payment in full at the time of booking. I had many reservations about this due to the terms,(cleaning fee damage deposit) but went ahead and reserved my room. Taking several days for the confirmation I became quite nervous that I had been a victim of internet fraud. Immediately after my booking was confirmed I contacted the resort and was greeted on the phone by a very pleasant friendly lady who assured me that this was a family friendly resort.A top notch facility. When inquiring about the units she suggested that I would be comfortable in Block 7-8 top floor. Approximately two weeks before our arrival , I emailed like I do at all destinations to make sure that everything was in order. When I failed to receive a response I contacted Tuscana Resort two days before our scheduled arrival. Again I was greeted by a very friendly lady that informed me everything was in order and my time share tour would be the day after arriving. When I told her that I had never agreed to a tour everything in her demeanor changed. It appeared now that I was booked into block 5 second floor. Through experience in my travels(RED FLAGS!) I should have known better . When we arrived I found exactly what I suspected. The lobby or clubhouse as they call it, is nothing more than a time share sales office. After waiting several minutes for those on the phones desperately promoting time share sales, I was finally approached by TJ. Going through check in he reminded me of an inexperienced used car salesman, when I questioned why my Jan. contact with the above mentioned lady was not logged into the computer and honored he became evasive. Now the good part. Upon entering our two bedroom unit, I was greeted by the foul smell of animal urine and cigarette smoke When I opened the patio door to help disappate the vulgar odor , I was blasted by the intense traffic noise from the I 4 , literally meters away.The unit had two double beds not the double and two twins that I was confirmed to get. Not letting my family enter the unit, I immediately returned to TJ to request an appropriate unit. He informed me that perhaps there was something he could do. Returning several minutes later with a smug look on his face, TJ informed me that the resort was completely booked and If I didn't like it I could go somewhere else. I would by no means receive any kind of refund. Having 2 tired children exhausted from a days travel, I returned to the unit.Checking out the pool area was not much better, stained pool and wore patio furniture. That evening was absolutely the most horrific experiences I have ever spent in a condo.The bathroom was disgusting and I had to clean it before I would permit my children to us it (view photo) Not only the traffic noise but the karaoke resignated through the entire unit and to make matters worse, the tenants above us jumped, stomped until the wee hours of the morning. There is absolutley no security at this facility after dark as I found, so don't try to complain to anyone. The following morning I moved my family to the Sheraton (please read my reviews). Returning saturday morning to retrieve grocery items that I had left on site I was lucky enough to talk to a member of the staff that was more than willing to disclose how this place runs. Yes TJ there were clean two bedroom units available in block 7-8 but these are prepared for prospective time share sales and I also was informed that there were several 3 bedroom units available,but not worth the loss of sixty dollars for an unsatisfied guest that won't be buying a time share. This facility was clearly constructed with the cheapest quality and poor location choice that has come back to haunt them and now they must nickel and dime vulnerable guests to try and keep the lights on. I hope this review will prevent others from being misled and taken advantage of by the scrupulous individuals running this low budget establishment.Tuscana Resort is great choice for those that need a place to pass out after a evening of binge drinking.",2011/03/08,2011/02/01,Traveled with family,7  ,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keeperof4,50,6,man,,6,149,133,,68,29,18,19,15,0,0,155,New Brunswick,2009/03/01, 15213 ,46,2019/01/02

EVER!,Woodent Yulykta... D,"We selected this resort because I'm a member at ChampionsGate golf club and we were visiting DisneyWorld, so it was a great location for the combined trip. We paid for a 1 night stay at this resort with airline miles. There was no mention of any fees until after we already booked, there is a $35 ""cleaning fee"" that is charged if you are not staying at least 5 nights. Then when we got to the resort we were told that they needed to place a $300 hold on our credit card. The alternative was to pay another $30 (or higher) in cash instead of the hold. The person said that the hold would not be released for up to 14 business days, so we opted to to just pay in cash. We were highly frustrated at this point and considering not staying due to these surprise fees. We finally got to our room and they key didn't work. That was our boiling point, so we went back to the front desk and my wife had to argue with them over giving us a refund considering we never even set foot in a room. They said they couldn't refund our cash even though we had just given it to them 10 minutes earlier. They accused us of just not wanting to pay their fees, but if that was the case we wouldn't have paid them in the first place. Their customer service skills are non-existent and we are still having to call every day to try and get a refund. ""Toni"" called and left a message saying we would receive our refund 2 weeks ago, but we never received the money. And now every time we call we get screened and somehow the 2 people that are supposed to talk to are always out of the office. We will NEVER even consider staying at this place again. We paid approximately $159 with our miles and with the additional fees the total cost for 1 night is approximately $230. It is very troubling that a resort of this nature would play these games over $80. If you're a world class resort, the reputation of your business and satisfaction of possible future Customers should be a priority. We will continue calling until they realize that we're not just going to go away because they keep saying they're out of the office.",2010/12/27,2010/12/01,Traveled with family,4  ,,1,2,0,0,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meta4wzrd,53,4,man,25-34,14,26,32,Art and Architecture Lover,8,13,2,2,1,0,0,40,"Sun City Center, FL",2010/12/01, 3052 ,24,2019/01/02

BUT........We arrived and were put into a 3 bedroom unit in building 6 on the 4th floor. All we could hear was the traffic from I-4 all night long. We could not sleep at all. Then to top it off we had someone below us that lives in the building that had 2 dogs that would bark constantly. Sitting on the patio (which is supposed to be relaxing) was not done due to the traffic noise and the dogs barking. Also the linen truck and the garbage truck show up at like 4:30am and all you hear is the beeping from the truck backing up and the banging of the dumpster as they empty it. We went to the front desk the next day to ask to be moved but were told that they could not do it because they had promised the condo owner the revenue. We felt that it was the resort that promised the revenue not us and that to make our vacation pleasurable we wanted to be moved. Of all the conversations we had with the front desk we NEVER talked to a manager. He just relayed the messages through the front desk staff. Another complaint was that we had gone to Disney and came back at 11:30pm with 2 sleeping children only to find out that all four of our room keys did not work. My husband just caught the girls at the front desk before they locked the door for the night. They rekeyed the cards and told my husband that it said in their computer that they had us checking out that day even though we were not checking out until the next day. If we had not caught the front desk employee we would have been stuck outside our room. GRRRRRRR!!!!!! We ranted and raved about how wonderful this resort was until this last vacation. They would not do anything for us except give us a coupon for 1 night free stay. We have given them over a month of revenue in the past year and they are only willing to provide 1 night!!!

In fact they were hardly to be seen. Apartment was impressive until we couldn't enjoy a peaceful meal or sleep because you could hear every sneeze and stamp of the foot from our neighbours at the resort. There is one pool and for such a large complex it was surprisingly quiet. It was always a good 20-30 min drive to parks and I-drive which was reasonable until you hit morning or afternoon traffic. Gym facilities were poor. Gym was opened from 5am to 10pm yet a lot of the equipment was safety secured and had to be activated by staff who were not in til 8am. Defeats the purpose if opening gym at 5am.

The pool was great, and the poolside bar does a nice range of meals.Location wise it is ideal.

Had a great time . Was a bit daunted about the other reviews we read about the noise from the I4 . But emailed them about our concerns and we were placed away from the noise . Kids enjoyed the pool area especially at night when they made lots of friends and we could have a drink whilst they played happily with their new friends. The barmaid was especially kind with my daughter when she ordered pepperoni pizza requesting extra pepperoni and came back with loads . Apartment was nice great for our needs . Not much natural light as you have only 3 windows but when you're at the parks all day its going dark anyway when you get back .Kitchen had plenty of appliances much more than we needed as we eat out mainly when we visit . Great chillis restaurant down the road and publix supermarket . About 15mins from disney and 30 mins from universal and seaworld . Staff were very pleasant and polite .Hoping to stay here again next year.,2010/10/03,2010/08/01,Traveled with family,1  ,4,4,5,0,0,5,5,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paula0970,32,3,woman,35-49,,9,7,Family Vacationer,3,5,0,0,1,0,0,9,"Bolton, United Kingdom",2008/11/01, 1242 ,13,2019/01/02

Hotel location is great, close to parks and airport.Before coming I called the resort and asked for quiet unit, not close to the highway. Actually highway noise is nothing in comparison to karaoke.For three nights we could not sleep because of extremly loud noise in Tuscana Tavern at the pool. Every second night they have extremely loud outside karaoke going on from 7 pm to midnight. I called the front desk and the bar and complained, they promised to stop soon but still nasty karaoke was going on until midnight. The guy doing karaoke thing actualy has a good voice, I would enjoy it at a different time.Avoid any building close to the the pool area, especially Building #1 which is about 200 -300 ft away from karaoke! Sleeping is impossible 7 pm through midnight every second night.Also Building #1 must be avoided because it is the 1st one inside the gates. So every car has to pass it on the way out and in. The cars going outside always drive over a rain drain making loud noise.Be careful if you are filling up your rental car near Orlando airport.

There were 3 of us and we had a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom. Its was MASSIVE and beautifully clean. The hotel reception staff were always helpful. The highlight of Tuscana is the bar which is English run!. The food is VERY GOOD and extremley good value for money. There is kareoke 3 times a week which you can either go down to listen to whilst having a nice cold beer or be boring and stay in the room. I would recommend if you are looking for a quieter holiday to ask to be given a room in either block 5 or 6. We were in block 5 and couldn't hear a thing.

Great size apartment, facilities excellent. Very slight noise from the motorway nothing that kept us awake. We were staying further into the resort next to the golf course though. Publix Supermarket 5 mins away very good, as is the busy Chilli's restaurant. Attractions/Shopping less than 25 minutes away. Apartment had free internet connection through an ethernet cable so take your laptopWHAT WE DID:Canoeing - http://www.canoewekiva.com and did the Katie's Landing trip (8 miles). Good but be aware there is only one real place to stop for a picnic which is around the 7 mile mark. Other than that it's eat in your canoe. It's very scenic but basically marshland with alligators, birds, and the occasional colourful spiders. Katie's Landing destination is not sign posted and is difficult to find. Once you go under the big bridge it's at least another half mile up river on the right. The locals will tell you it's just after the bridge... It's not an easy route in terms of distance versus the time you have to complete it.Airboat Ride - http://www.bcairboats.com. Half hour trip and was worth it. One oddity is they take your photo but you can't buy that picture on it's own, you have to buy 3 or 4 copies of it. ADVICE - Wear the ear defenders. They may not be the height of teenage fashion but the boats are very noisy. A great fun activity and we saw mum and baby alligatorsChef John's Dockside Inn - http://www.chefjohnsdocksideinn.com. Great food and service excellent, worth the trip into the old part of Kissimee townUniversal Studios - Great but disappointed with the organisation for Harry Potter World. This is very very popular because it's new so although you have your ticket into Universal you need to get another ticket (free) inside the park to then get into HP World. They didn't tell us this and we had to go back to near the main gates to get the additional tickets, by which time you were even further down the queue. Annoying as we made a special effort to get there early. Queueing is into HOURS for the various sights and rides especially so for HP but alsso for the main rides in both Universal ParksClearwater Beach - 90 minute journey but the beach is well worth it.

Good size condos that have most of the comforts of home. Our famility enjoyed our stay here and we would probably do it again but consider this before you make your reservations:1) If you want quiet, don't stay here. Almost every day between 6 and 7AM a laundry truck backs through the parkng lot with a very loud backup buzzer. While the condos on the golf course side of the comlex have a great view of the course. You also overlook the parking lot and you'll have to deal with that truck every day. Not so great if you looked forward to sleeping in. Consider asking for a room on the woods slide of the complex, it should be quieter over there. This really isn't the best place to stay if you're looking for quiet. The noise from condos above (walking on floors), people walking up and down the hallway stairs and the general parking lot activity can be a little loud at times. We have teenagers so noise wasn't a big deal for us, but if you have young ones who sleep lightly this won't be the place for you.2) Your reservations are not refundable for ANY reason. Read your contract. Our travel plans got messed up so we arrived one day earlier than expected and had to leave one day earlier than we reserved. The total length of our stay was the same, we were just off schedule by one day. The front desk gladly let us check in the one day earlier (charging us for the extra day, which we expected.) Unfortnately, they would not refund our money for the day at the end of the trip that we would not be using. This resulted in us paying for a night which we could not use. I think the front desk staff could have been a little nicer in how they handled the situation.3) These are condos so I'm not sure if every unit is furnished exactly the same, but the bedding in our units was very uncomfortable. The owners of our unit chose a low end mattress which was dissapointing given how nice everything else was in the unit.4) We were part of a large group staying here so we received a deeply discounted rate to stay here. The deal we received made this an excellent value for our money. If we had to pay full price to stay here, I think I could have gotten a better value for just as nice of a complex elsewhere.",2010/07/17,2010/07/01,Traveled with family,,5,4,3,0,0,4,3,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DJF5502,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,0,0,1,"Nashville, Tennessee",2010/07/01, 100 ,4,2019/01/02

I must admit that on checking this website 2 months before we were due to fly i was having major doubts, afterall this was my Honeymoon and i wanted everything to be perfect, there had been several reviews stating that it the resort was dirty, noisy, that there was never any beds by the pool availabe and that the rooms were not cleaned properly. This did worry me but after working 5 years as an Overseas Holiday Rep i knew that everyone's entitled to their own opinion and we decided to give it a go. I can say that from the minute we pulled up at the resort we did not look back. We were welcomed at reception as though we were old friends, yes there was a non refundable deposit of $39 to pay which we knew about already as it is clearly stated on the resorts site.The block we were in was block 7 and i was pleased to hear.....NOTHING! I was so worried about the comments on here about the traffic noise for months leading up to the holiday but can say that it did not effect us at all and we come from the countryside where the only noise you hear is the cows.The APARTMENT was clean, tidy and was exactly what we were hoping it would be, great cooking facilities, kitchen 2 bedrooms both ensuite and enough toilet paper, washing up liquid etc to last the first few days. We only ate out once in the evening and this was at the Taverna on site - I have to say that the food was out of this world, after repping many selfcatering apartments and eating at the bar's in them, THE MEALS AT THE TUSCANA TAVERNA WERE THE BEST WE HAVE HAD FROM AN ON RESORT RESTAURANT, i would highly reccommend that you try the Tuscana Chicken when you are there.(they also do takeaway's!) The bar/restuarant staff couldn't have been more helpful, we also went to the Karaoke a that was on twice a week which was great fun. The bar was not noisy and open until the eraly hours keeping you awake as someone had mentioned, in fact it closed between 11-12pm each night.LOCATION: This is a perfect loctaion for anyone that is looking to do any of the parks whilst in orlando, we have stayed at another area before but as this was right off the I4 it was so easy to get to and from with no quick exits or trying to cross busy roads. You can walk from the resort to Championsgate where there is a few stores and places to eat. Takes around 10 minutes but the road is really quite as only goes to the resort so very safe.POOL: The pool area was clean and tidy and no matter what time of the day you went there we always managed to get a bed as it was never full.All in all i would highly reccommend this to familes, couples or solo travellors as a great base when in orlando. We will be going back there and will tell all our firnds/family and work collegues about it!!!",2010/05/19,2010/05/01,Traveled as a couple,,4,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happychicks,58,,woman,25-34,,1,,,,,,,,0,0,5,Devon,2006/11/01, 180 ,3,2019/01/02

When we found out that our flight had been cancelled the girl at reception managed to move things around so that we could stay in the same condo for another week. On top of this they gave us the room at a reduced rate due to the circumstances. We really appreciated this as we had to pay this out of our own pocket.The condo itself was very spacious and had plenty of room for two adults and two children. The kitchen was well equipped and was great having the dishwasher &amp; washing machine/dryer. We were in Block 5 which was quite near to the I4 and we did hear the traffic noise the first couple of nights but after that we got used to it and it never really bothered us.The pool area is lovely we found that plenty of sunbeds were always available. It was very clean and the Internet room was very useful due to the situation we found ourselves in.We really enjoyed our stay at the Tuscana and would not hesitate staying there again.,2010/05/02,2010/04/01,Traveled with family,,4,5,5,0,0,5,4,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stenny_10,4,1,,,,4,8,,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,Larbert Scotland,2010/05/01, 408 ,11,2019/01/02

The couch is a little on the dinky side and the pullout bed wasn't very comfy, but most of them aren't anyway. They obviously don't take care of the trash on the weekends. because when we pulled up, there was a huge buzzard hanging out on top of the bin and there was trash all around it.. We even saw a girl on one of the go-carts go over to it, but she picked up one thing and left. By the time we got back Monday evening, the trash had obviously come through. Great location to Disney and Universal area. Super convenient to Publix, liquor store, 7-11, The only major problem we had was when Elsa I think her name was..She checked us in. We got to the condo, unpacked all of our stuff. Well she called my cell phone and said there was a mistake and she gave us the wrong room, so we had to go back and get a new one. Okay, not happy with that, but the real pisser was when we threw all of our stuff back in the car, I went to the front desk and she said No, It was a mistake after all.I tried calling your cell phone, but it went to voicemail. So we went back to the room. Never once, did she apologize for the inconvenience and she never called my phone, because other than the first call, it never was on there. And if she realized her mistake, why didnt she call the actual room or walk herself down to our condo!!!

We were at the front of Block 2 which faces away from the pool area so it might be a lot noiser in a different location. The resort is in a reasonably good location with quick access to the I-4 so getting to the theme parks and so on is quite easy. There's a Chili's restaurant at the end of the road which you could walk to but be prepared for a wait as it's usually busy. There's a 7-11 and a Publix within about 0.5 mile as well.

We had a unit in block 1 right next to the swimming pool (#1204) - we had a side view of the pool from our balcony and a front view of the car park - not a problem. This unit was lovely and peaceful the first night until ""Axel Rose"" kicked in with his karaoke until 12pm on the 2nd night and occassional subsequent nights thereafter - probably being more than once a week because of the Easter break. Don't get me wrong we are no old timers and love a good old sing song, however, when you are up at 7am to get to the theme parks for opening to then spend 13 hours walking round them, all you want to do is come home and flop into bed - this was impossible on all the occasions the karaoke was playing because it was far too loud and ""Axel Rose"" liked to scream through the microphone at every given opportunity. Robert, the duty manager did offer to move us accross the car park but we decided against that because we didn't want to waste half a day moving everything that had already been unpacked. He did speak to the bar owners, who are in charge of the karaoke nights, and made sure that it finished at 11.30pm prompt, which we did appreciate him doing. This would not put us off returning as we feel for the money it is a great value place - however, next time we will make sure we are not right next to the swimming pool and within such close proximity to the bar.On a separate note the food in the bar is AMAZING, especially the burger and chips!One note to the owners of Tuscana - because we were there at a very busy time of year the pool was very crowded and in constant demand and the beds went very early in the morning. We did notice quite a few people coming down very early before 8am(!) to reserve their beds and then not using them for quite a while after.

We rented a three bedroom Tuscana condo for a month because my son and his wife, who lived near-by, had just had their second child and we wanted to be close but not an inconvenience for that long of a time frame. The three bedroom condo at Tuscana was like a dream come true. It was immaculate and exquisitely furnished. We felt so at home. We were able to prepare our own meals and do our laundry which was such an economical plus. We were even able to bring Great Grandma along and she was pleasantly surprised at how easily she was able to get around. The heated pool and spa were amazing despite the colder weather, which I'm told was not the normal Orlando winter. We especially enjoyed the food at the Tuscana Tavern and Restaurant and found the prices reasonable. For anyone who hasn't tried them, the homemade potato chips are out of this world! With two little grandchildren living near-by we hope to be able to return to Tuscana again and again. Thanks again to the friendly and helpful staff.

Having read the reviews before we travelled and now having been there, I can actually see why there is such a mixture of reviews. There are good aspects to this place but it felt to us as if they ran out of money half way through. On arrival it all looks fine at a glance but there are silly things that simply let it down and the owners need to invest some, but not really alot of, money if they really want to compete against the millions of other properties on offer in the area. You do need to be concious that some blocks are next to the interstate but we asked for the furthest away and couldnt hear any road (or indeed any other) noise at all. There is no maid service and the towels you are given at the beginning are yours for the entire stay. The barest of supplies are suppied and you will have to go shopping to stock up on loo rolls, shower gel, dishwasher tabs, washing powder etc. The only thing we were given enough of was washing up liquid and soap but there is an excellent Publix less than 5 mins drive away. Internally, the condo had a really old and dark feel to it and smelt musty, the carpets were hoovered but stained and the furniture and fittings were of cheap quality. Our balcony was permanently in the shade and had a view of the car park and bins so we didnt use it but there were others that seemed to have a lovely view - think we were just unlucky. The white goods were all great and worked well. The beds are comfy but the pillows are shockingly naff as are the blind / curtain arrangements in the bedrooms. There are two small venetian blinds at the windows that do not span the entire width and dont meet in the middle either so do nothing to stop the light getting in. There are curtains either side of the window but they are only about 4"" wide and are purely decorative. The pool area is lovely but the pool heater was broken while we were there so we were only able to swim in the pool once during our 2 week stay. The hotel claim this was due to unusually low temperatures but we had 3/4 days in the high 60s and 70s so I just dont believe this, especially as there are reports spanning several months with the same complaint. The temperature in the hot tub was never the same twice and ranged from freezing cold to absolutely boiling and because the pool was so cold it was what most people 'swam' or rather dunked in during the day. There is no wireless internet and the cabled internet in our condo did not work once during our entire stay. We have been to Florida before and wherever you stay you tend to need to drive or be driven so you do need a car here but you would anywhere in Orlando. You are probably not more than 20-30 minutes from any of the attractions and within 10 minutes drive in any direction there are more restaurants than you could ever visit during a holday - the Chillis restaurant at the drive into the resort offered great value, with a good menu and service. I must say that the bar staff at the Tuscana were all so friendly and couldnt do enough to make you feel welcome. The food was also surprisingly delicious and served with a friendly smile. Dave and his wife really do put such a lot of effort into keeping it a clean and happy place and there was always a nice ambience there (day or night). If the price is cheap and/or the weather good then Tuscana would be good as a base and if it was smartened up and a little bit of time and attention paid to the finer details, this would actually be a lovely haven away from the madness of the parks. Unfortunately, we paid full whack for this and although overall we had a good holiday, it was because we made it one away from the resort and we would not come back here as we have stayed in far better (Bahama Bay is also 4 star and similar price but is way way better).",2010/03/18,2010/02/01,Traveled as a couple,,3,3,2,0,0,3,3,3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vivvyp,3,,woman,35-49,,2,1,,,,,,,0,0,2,Surrey,2009/04/01, 201 ,5,2019/01/02

It's in a very convenient location...about a half-hour ride from the airport, and right off the I-4 highway. It's a gated facility, and you need a four-digit pass code for the gate to open.We booked a one-room unit thru BJ's Travel, and were pleasantly surprised when we were upgraded to a two-bedroom / two-bathroom unit. I had read in prior reviews that there were hardly any one-room units, and others had also been upgraded. Check-in was a breeze. We bought the $39 ""Insurance-Policy"" considering that our 4 year-old was with us, and something could get broken. It was really nice to have the washer and dryer in the unit, as well as the full kitchen. We took the 10-minute ride to the Publix market and stocked up on groceries. There are six buildings and we were in building 5 on the third floor. We were in unit #5307. Our balcony overlooked a wooded area, and you could see and hear I-4 traffic, but we didn't mind. The front of the building overlooked the Reunion Golf Course. I think it was the 16th green of their ""Tradition"" course. The hot tub was super hot and clean. The whole pool area was beautiful, but it never got warm enough for us to enjoy the pool. I guess this was the coldest winter in Florida since 1958. There's a nice pub attached to the pool area. Thursday nights they have Karaoke which was a fun time.We didn't spend much time at the resort. We traveled all over Florida. Locally we enjoyed GatorLand.... a must see. We also took the drive to the Kennedy Space Center followed by a stop at Ron Jon Surf Shop in Cocoa Beach.

We will definitely consider staying there again in teh future.The entire complex is very well kept, not at an official five star hotel category level, but everything is clean, functional and most of the staff are very friendly and helpful, too. We had two little issues which might not a be an issue for most people at all. First, we arrived very early. Of course we knew official check in time was 4p, but we tried our luck anyways. And yes, we had luck, we were told we could have our suite any time after 1 p. So we went grocery shopping and came back at 2p just to be told the suite isn't ready and won't be any time soon. It was ready at 4, but you kind of rely on them, if they tell you you can have it earlier. One of the Ladies was very nice and apologetic about it, the other very rude and unfriendly.The other issue revolves around the Tuscana allowing pets. We never had issues with animals on the property, but since I'm very sensitive to pet hair and it causes me breathing problems, I had issues with pet hair in the suite. The carpet seemed to be shampooed and everything was nice and clean, but there was still the odd hair. There always is. You can't avoid it. So I would like to see the Tuscana to designate 100% pet free apartments in the future, for people like me. Some people mentioned the highway passing very close by. It hasn't been an issue at all for us. Our building was facing away from the highway, so we heard nothing at all, but we even talked to people living in the building next to the highway, and they said it is only an issue, if you keep your windows open at night.

It was disappointing to say the least. We (family of 5 ) arrived at 2:30 in the morning to our 3 bedroom condo (which was in the building 6 “right” beside the Interstate 4.) After a long flight, I was just turning back the sheets to tuck my kids into bed, when I saw blood all over the sheets, the pillow, and the comforter, all four beds were checked, and 3 out of the four beds were covered in blood.Well at 2:30 in the morning and the office is not open at night our choices were very limited. All of the extra blankets in the closet had blood on them, as well as the pillows. It was enough blood to make you question if there was a stabbing or something happened in that room. The dresser still had chips, and other stuff in them, and we found a medication container in the closet, and yes I took pictures of everything! In the morning after talking only to the front clerk, (the manager wouldn’t/didn’t even come out to talk to me) I guess maybe the bloody blanket that I spread out at the Hotel Office, for everyone to see, and my cell phone with all the pictures on it convinced them that maybe they should move us. However they had wanted us to pay for the cleaning fee, as we were already in that condo, -that didn’t happen though! Our next condo was much better, however we didn’t receive a phone call from management who we were told wanted to speak with us, and we had to track him down to speak with us, (3 days later.) I would’ve at least appreciated an apology for the condition of our room. The other issue we had was that the website says that the pool was heated. We did have not the greatest of weather, but the pool was so cold that the kids were playing in the hot tub, and the pool was “suposedly”set for 84 degrees, everyone was told. The Tuscana actually is quite a nice place, but the management is what bring this place down! If Management actually existed maybe our stay would have been better!People- there are so many places to stay in Orlando and surroundings –WHY STAY HERE. If I was to give advice to anyone about this place I would say: Go and enjoy yourself somewhere else this place just doesn’t deserve your time, money or efforts, and find a place that they actually value their customers.",2010/03/04,2010/02/01,Traveled with family,3  ,1,1,1,0,0,4,3,3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sasha11_10,1,,,,,1,3,,,,,,,0,0,1,Saskatchewan,2010/03/01, 103 ,4,2019/01/02

Not that this was their fault, but the weather was really bad for the 1200 mile trip we took. We went into the lobby area to check-in and were ignored by the staff for about 5 minutes. It was 1:30 and were informed check in is not till 4 sorry, but we will take a deposit of 300 on a credit card/debit/credit that we will give back to you in 30 to 45 days or you can pay a non-refundable fee of 39 dollars! We signed everything and informed the young lady (had no clue) that we would really like to get a shower. She did offer to let us use the pool shower rooms, however we need to come back no earlier than 4. She was actually paying more attention to the older lady behind us then my husband and I. (Frustrating). We then were informed they have pool towels, but if you do not return them before check out there would be a 10 dollar fee. We came back at 4, checked into our room, room looks just like the picture. The only prob with the room was the outlet cover was broken for the internet. We informed the staff and they simply brushed it off. (We didn't care about it being broken, we just were not going to be charged for something we didn't do). We were allotted 2 rolls of toilet paper and one packet of dish washing detergent. You are informed to buy anything else, that is all they allow per stay. Then, when you went to use the toilet there was a sign posted if anything other than toilet paper plugs this toilet you will be charged a $50 fee. I started thinking to myself, am i going to have extra charges when i leave this place? We were in the last building all the way in the back, perfect! We didn't hear anything, it was absolutely serene. On the second day, we went to the pool and asked for towels, sorry we are out! Third day the same, then the last day of our stay we asked for some, they actually said, ""you are checking out tomorrow"". My husband's response was ""Yeah and we have only came down for towels three times and you haven't had any, im getting the freak n towels and you will have them back tomorrow!"" Also, the third night of our stay, my husband and i went to use the hot tub, the heater wasn't working and this is after they supposedly fixed it. Their customer service was very poor and maybe they don't understand because they are sitting at a desk all day checking ppl in and out, but when you spend a lot of money to take a trip, the last thing you want is crappy customer service and to be treated as if you are trash!

We thought a peaceful last 5 days was better than nothing so duly turned up at reception on the allotted day (after packing up, stripping beds etc) to be told no-one knew anything about this, nothing was available, the relevant manager wasnt in that day and there was nothing they could do. We were really upset.

The condos are great! They are spacious and very comfortable. I loved having the patio to relax outside after a long day at the park.

The resort is 5 min from the grocery store and a pharmacy.The pool area is large and beautiful...we didn't get to use it as we got to experience the record lows in Florida. We loved having the casual restaurant with great food and delicious drinks.The location of the resort is perfect, right off the highway to give us easy access to the parks but the resort is quiet and relaxing.

We had a groung floor, three bedroom apartment which was in Block 1. This is nearest to the club house &amp; pool area. It was very spacious &amp; clean. 4 TV's, fully equipt kitchen, washer &amp; dryer, everything we needed. The internet access was down when we arrived, so I advised reception the next day. It took 4 days of gentle reminders to get it fixed, but in the mean time there was a business centre in the clubhouse which had 2 PC's for internet access. The pool area was great, a large heated pool, (very) hot tub, unheated kids pool, pleanty of loungers and several cabanas. There is a pool-side bar area that serves drinks and food which are reasonably priced. It's run by a lovely british couple, who are very friendly. We were in Florida to get married, and they kept the bar open late that night so that we could carry-on when we returned to the Tuscana after our reception. There is a Chilis restaurant at the bottom of the road (about half a mile) along with a Publix supermarket, Wallgreens, McDonalds, 2 petrol stations and other stores. The other good point was that there was no pushy time share sales at all, it was just come, stay &amp; enjoy - which we did. The only real draw-back that I could see is that it is along-side the I4 and the apartment blocks furthest from the club house could possibly be quite noisy. We are planning to return this year and will stay at the Tuscana again.",2010/02/24,2009/05/01,Traveled with family,1  ,5,4,5,1,4,5,4,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sherzy,4,1,man,35-49,6,2,1,,,,,,,0,0,8,Maidstone,2009/06/01, 381 ,7,2019/01/02

The prices were very good for the Orlando area. The room was more than adequate. The bathrooms are nice, there is granite everywhere, and the beds were comfortable. We had 8 adults in a 3 bedroom condo and we all fit fine. We cooked breakfast in the condo and ate out mostly at night. The place was quiet and the people were all freindly and helpful. The only issue was that the sheet on the pull out couch was very dirty when we arrived.

The amenities provided in the condo were beyond my expectations, dishwasher, large hob and oven, microwave, 3 tv's one in each of the bedrooms and one in the living area, but the best was having a washing machine and dryer as i was able to bring all my clothes home clean. make sure to go to the orlando premium outlets off exit 68, when i come back next january i will not be bringing much clothes with me as on top of the already cheap prices there was the january sales and i got so many bargains that i ended up paying 100 dollars for excess luggage coming back home.Overall the Tuscana Resort is the best place i have ever stayed and believe me i have been to hundreds of hotels, already planning our next holiday to florida and will 100% be staying at Tuscana.......thankyou for making my first trip to the USA an amazing experience",2010/01/23,2010/01/01,Traveled with family,2  ,5,5,5,0,0,5,,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debi1160,65,3,woman,35-49,,10,10,,2,5,2,1,0,0,0,10,Bolton,2010/01/01, 1025 ,16,2019/01/02

The cost was $155 per night, for a 3 bedroom with kitchen. The room was incredibly spacious, with one bedroom at the front of the apartment, and 2 at the other end - this was nice since I have young kids, and didn't want them to hear us late at night. We were a 10 minute drive from Disney World, and 3 minute drive from tons of amazing golf courses. The one thing that I did not like about Tuscana was the dirty carpets in the room we stayed in. My in-laws stayed in a different room, and their carpet was much nicer. Having said that, the rest of the apartment was very clean. People who wish to stay here should be aware that Tuscana is not a hotel, and therefore no products, such as shampoo, soap, dish detergent, laundry soap, are provided - they do provide a starter kits, so you get one of each, but be prepared to bring your own. Also, the maid service is only after your departure, so don't expect someone lese to make your bed. As long as you know this in advance, it is a great place to stay.Lastly, the pool is very nice, warm water, nice play area for children, and a nice bar.",2010/01/22,2010/01/01,Traveled with family,2  ,5,4,5,0,0,5,,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reddytotravel,2,,woman,35-49,,2,8,,,,,,,0,0,2,toronto,2007/08/01, 208 ,5,2019/01/02

I wasn't impressed because of the build up made by the website and other positive reviews. The resort was a let down in many ways.I had called a few days before our trip to just make sure we didn't need anything else to check in then we already knew. The lady who answered the phone was short and not very friendly. We stayed in a Super 8 on our drive home with friendlier staff.The internet wasn't wireless which was a surprise...it wouldn't have been a big deal if the cable actually worked. We had to have a technician come in and fix it only for the internet to give out 3 days later. We went in January and were planning on going swimming because of the advertised ""heated pool"" and ""hot tub"". The pool was not heated. The hot tub was a WARM tub and we froze trying to get it to work.The $300 deposit made us both very wary about using or doing much in the room. It felt like it wasn't our for the week but on loan and that if we dirtied the tiniest thing we would get charged for it. I felt like I had to be overly concerned with the room which made it slightly less enjoyable to stay there. We aren't pigs either but we didn't know how they would judge us on our stay just to get a buck.The location was alright. It was very desolate. There wasn't much life around the resort. Our veranda looked out at ugly brush. It also was in a prime spot next to I-4 which you could hear from the porch. When 9pm hits, the staff goes home and you are there alone. I've been to 3.5 star resorts that have atleast a nightguard in the guard box. There guard box at the gate into the rooms was just there for show. It is labled ""guard box"" but is completely empty. The curtains in the bedroom weren't able to close at all which let in a lot of sun light in the morning. When you're on vacation and would like to sleep late, it was fairly impossible.The in room dryer took 2 1/2 hours to dry. We had to check out and find a laundry mat in florida to finish drying our tiny pile of clothes that we wore that week. Overall we weren't impressed and we would not return to the Tuscana Resort.

I contacted Hotwire and they spoke to the resort. The resort assured Hotwire they would clean the unit and the front desk button on the phone does not ring front desk so don't use it. The 2 items were removed when we returned but a worn towel was still there with pubic hairs entangled in it and the toilet was still filthy.

Comparing this to other self-catering accommodation we have stayed in all over the world, this is wonderful accommodation and one of the best we've been in. Check-in was short and sweet which was what we needed after 3 flights from Belfast to Orlando. Entrance to parking lots is by a private 4 digit code allowing access via large electronic gates. Our condo was easily reached by elevator to the 3rd floor. The kitchen had large fridge/freezer, cooker, microwave, kettle, dishwasher and at least an 8 piece set of dinnerware and all necessary cooking utensils making breakfast and making own meals very easy. The large washer/drier was invaluable and easy to operate. Everything was clean and dust free.The 3 very good sized double bedrooms were immaculate, as was the en-suite (with an enormous shower) and the main bathroom (with a bath/shower combi). There was always PLENTY of hot water day and night. Each of the 3 bedrooms had good bedlinen and pillows with extra blankets for the cooler evenings; in each bedroom there was also a television and a wardrobe (one was a walk-in wardrobe). The sitting room had a sofa bed and 2 chairs, a coffee table, a large TV and a DVD player. The balcony (which was conveniently screened in for safety and to keep us bug-free) had a table and chairs set where we ate our breakfast and enjoyed a cuppa late at night when the weather/temperatures allowed. My friends stayed in a 2 bedroom condo and found it to be more than enough space also with all the same excellent facilities; however, they were in Block 4 which was at the roadside and noisy at night whereas we we were in Block 8 which was very quiet day and night.We did not eat in the on-site restaurant as we cooked our own meals with food bought from the nearby Publix and SuperWalmart or we ate out in local restaurants - we highly recommend the Cracker Barrel at Exit 55.The pool area was clean and attractive and the jacuzzi was very hot indeed. The 'business room' consists of 2 PCs and a printer which were adequate for the Internet access that we required.Driving to and from Disney, SeaWorld, Universal, outlet malls, airports etc was easy as it is so close to the I-4 but when traffic congestion built up on the main road it was also easy to use the other roads to get to and from 'home'.I highly recommend this resort to anyone looking for selfcatering with style, expecially those with young children who want a separate bedroom for their young ones so everyone can get a good night's sleep after a long day at Disney.

Easy access, great for WDW!",oakmhr,"Stayed at Tuscana in mid October 2009 for a week. Was in town for a convention. Location right off of I4 at exit 58, just a few miles from the WDW exits. 15 minutes to I-Drive and the convention center. 5 minutes to DisneyWorld. Publix, 24 hour Walgreens, gas and a Chilis just at the entrance road to the resort. Drove in from Tampa, took 45 mins. Cheaper airfares than MCO. I had a 1 bedroom room. Very clean and spacious for 1 person. A family of 4 would have plenty of room. 1 bed and 1 pullout sofa. Queen sizes on both. Full kitchen, however no microwave. I was in a handicapped room which only meant that I didnt have a vanity in the bathroom and had a shower wand. Excellent water pressure!!! Soap and shampoo and even toothpaste provided. Very nice touch. Staff was very helpful at 11AM check-in, was in my room in less than 10 minutes. Top notch security, not that they need it, but there is a controlled gate that you enter a pass code for. I felt like I was entering my own palatial Hollywood Hills estate! Bed was very comfortable, two huge closets in the room. Hair dryer, ironing board and iron in the room. 2 tvs, no VCR or DVD however, but I didnt need either. Washer and dryer in the room which is awesome. Huge bathroom. Very clean throughout!!! Full size refrigerator. I didn't have any cleaning during the week I was there, and to note there is a $39 fee or if you choose, a hold put on you credit card upon check in. I did the $39 resort fee since I was on an expense account. No hassles at all, wonderful check-in experience. Pool area is awesome. Very nice grounds, and excellent hot tub. Temperature was just right for the pool and hot tub. Karaoke in the evening and pool side snacks and drinks!! Pool open till 10PM. Very easy access from any building in the resort. I was on the 4th floor, there are elevators and had a great view of the neighboring golf course. My unit did not have a patio since it was a 1 bedroom. The other units have a screened in, very nice patio with chairs and table. the larger units look very nice as well, I poked my head in one being prepped. All in all a top notch stay, excellent location, quiet, a little away from the hustle and bustle of the LBV and Kissimmee area but still very close and with easy access to I4. Will definitely stay here again with family on a WDW trip!! I booked through Travelocity. Fantastic job Tuscana Resort and staff!! Check out was equally easy, wish I could have stayed longer!!

Very pleased with her knowledge and suggestions. Front desk will give you her number. If you know your plans she can hook you up with everything you need. We went zip lining and I would highly recommend, if you do not have a fear of heights.

There have been some negative reviews on this site.We have come to the decision that some people are too fussy and would find things to complain about wherever they stayed.

Each fully furnished unit has 2 bathrooms, a DVD and TV in every bedroom, a fully equipped kitchen, a washer &amp; dryer, and a screened balcony. There is a beautiful swimming pool with shade cabanas and a large deck area, a kiddie pool, a movie theater, a cafe, an exercise facility, and elevators in every building. The staff is caring, friendly and helpful. One caveat - if you plan to stay several days, I suggest that you bring (or purchase) extra soap, tissues, and toilet paper because only 1 roll of toilet paper per bathroom is provided, the bar of soap is very small and tissues are not provided. Also, we discovered that cell phone reception in some of the units can be spotty although good reception can be had on the balconies. We had booked at Tuscana because of a wedding that we would be attending at a hotel nearby. It offered more comfort at a better price than we could get elsewhere in the vicinity. To say that we were satisfied, would be an understatement. We and the other wedding guests LOVED the place. It exceeded our expectations!! The beds and linens were so-o-o comfortable and the pool area was wonderful for swimming, lounging and hanging out. The housekeeping was outstanding Everything was clean and inviting. Several of our friends said that they liked it so much that they were going to plan a family reunion there and others said they cannot wait to return.",2009/10/13,2009/10/01,Traveled with family,,5,5,5,0,0,5,,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LesieK,2,,woman,65+,,2,1,,,,,,,0,0,2,"Miami, Florida",2009/10/01, 201 ,6,2019/01/02

We had a family of 3 with a young child and two grandparents. Our reviews are a bit mixed about this place, but definitely the pros outweigh the cons because we are returning again this year for the same week. You could definitely do much worse in the world of Orlando condo/time share rentals!The PROS:Amazing pool. Large, resort-like, relaxing, and ample lounge chairs. Nice layout of 3 bedroom units. Modern kitchens + washer/dryerThe screened-in patio- we ate breakfast out here every day!Proximity to Disney- 10-15 minutes by car depending on trafficThe CONS:Could be noisy at times. Stairs, people above you, doors slamming. Also if you are along the freeway that noise could be heard at all times. We had no ""starter"" stuff in our kitchen- had to purchase sponge, dishsoap, DW detergent, paper towels for cleanup, etc. Bring those or be prepared to purchase.Crazy parking lot- lots of near misses every day. Just drive carefully and be on guard!Slow elevator!Notes about the general area:We were unhappy with Publix prices and selection of groceries, they were out of many things. We drove on the I-4 one exit past Tuscana (heading away from the Disney area) and exited on to the 25/27 and found a wonderful Target off of Homerun Blvd. There we stocked up with groceries and goods that we needed for the week. Also, we found we spent a LOT of time at Celebration, FL (just a few exits up the I-4). It's quaint shops, great restaurants and Starbucks location made it an unexpected favorite destination. In fact, we spent New Year's Eve there and will do that again this year. Overall this was a good experience and we look forward to returning, noise and all!

We drove up to Orlando and were running late ( not difficult to believe as we ARE from Miami), I spoke to the reception area regarding a possible late arrival, they assured me that I would be serviced and to call if I ran into further difficulties. Checking in was a breeze, the security gate was a blessing, and the room and property were immaculately clean and impressively spectacular. After surveying the beautiful property, I went to the room. Not only was the room spacious and beautifully decorated, but welcoming and inviting! Plenty of towels and amenities. Our only trouble (small) was a loose shower knob in the guest bathroom. The next morning, I went to the office and spoke to the front desk regarding the knob; a few hours later, the knob was fixed and we received a note regarding who had come in and what they did. This was a courtesy that impressed me greatly! We enjoyed our time in Orlando and heavy hearted checked out of our LUXURY accommodations. Checking out was another breeze and we headed safely back to Miami. Overall, the experience was amazing! My only negative feedback would have been the online website. The picture originally there did the property absolutely no justice! I was SO pleased to see the website went through a great revamp!!

Place was real clean though I noticed some ""guests"" left rubbish bags outside their unit but the staff picked them up fairly quickly. Location is great for disney - only 5 miles and access to the interstate is great. It was busy but never crowded and the pool is great for young kids.

This was my 6th trip to Florida and my partners first and I have stayed in both villas and hotels before. This is by far the best resort I have stayed in and would recommend it to smaller parties i.e. those who aren't big enough to warrant a private villa rental. The restaurant and bar area are run by an English couple who clearly understand what the British look for in a holiday resort. They have been out there 4 years and will give you all those little details that a travel rep just wouldn't know or wouldn't tell you because it wouldn't make them any money! For example, we watched the space shuttle launch from the bar area and it was visible from the exact spot that the bar said it would be! Despite the fact that Florida offers a different type of holiday from what you would get in Europe, the pool area offers you that little bit of holiday that we all want i.e. a place to relax at the end of the day with a beer and the kids entertained! The pool area states that it closes at 10pm but my 9 year old was still safely swimming with other kids at 11pm whilst you are close enough to sit and relax with drink without worrying - the pool area is big enough that you can still have full view of your children. There is a small games room for kids and all machines are only 25 cents which means they can be entertained for ages for a couple of dollars. One night, we put a dollar in the pool table and not all of balls came out - told the barman who opened up the table and told us to play free all night! You wouldn't get that in Europe! The hot tub is great for adults but too hot for the kids! Its like having a bath! Food in the pool area is fantastic value - good quality, freshly prepared and extremely well priced. would highly recommend the fish and chips (this was recommended to us by the guy in the liquor store on our first night!). Extremely well located to everywhere - disney is about 15 minute drive but don't come off the I4 to join the 192, take the toll road 429 which takes you into the back road to disney - no cars or traffice whatsoever! The $40 pre-paid toll road fee at the airport is probably the best spend - you don't have to worry about coins or coming off the road to pay - they just read your licence plate. Karoke night is a bit loud but not that bad. Condos are better equipped than most UK homes - don't believe what the travel brochures say - there is a washing machine and tumble dryer in every one although limited space to dry clothes that can't be tumble dried - you basically have to hang them on the back of chairs or in your closet!. Our air-con broke three times whilst we were there but the minute you tell reception the maintenance guy is there within the hour and they always give you the option of him coming in whilst you are not there. Reception staff are not particularly professional looking buy are helpful but they don't tell you how to work the pass code to open the gate - I think that is the highlight of their day to sit and laugh at you whilst you try to find the keypad for the code! The keypad is located right outside reception, a good 50m before the gate - if you get to the security lodge and haven't entered a code, you have gone too far! Overall, an extremely well located, clean, quiet, secure and good value resort that is highly recommended for families. There is a Publix, subway, macdonalds, walgreens, chinese, 7eleven and chillis at the end of the road - you could walk it but the road is not well lit at night so I wouldn't recommend it but it is all about a 1 minute drive away. We are planning to return to Florida in two-three years time and would stay here again. My partner thought it was the best holiday he had ever been on and loves me for choosing this place!

I have to agree with the other reviewers that the noise between the floors (we had a family above us with little kids) got a little loud ... but it wasn't anything that was unbearable. Only 1 night it seemed the kids above us were running around late (11 pm) ... but other than that .. it was okay.Check in - this was quick. I asked the resort to send me a PDF of the bill which I'd prepaid - including the 39.00 property fee - so when I arrived to pick up my keys, I showed them the print out which said I was paid in full - and I picked up my keys and left. Took all of 10 min.First Impression of Condo - VERY NICE. We had a 3 bedroom/2 bathroom unit on the 3rd floor in the 8th building. We couldn't hear any noise from I-4; the unit was really large and very nice. There was a check list on the coffee table, and we went through it to make sure everything was there. The dining room table was set up nicely; the dishes appeared to be clean, but just to be on the safe side, I loaded everything into the dishwasher and washed all the dishes with the 2 little dishwasher soap tablets provided.Towels and Blankets - in the master suite which had its own bathroom there were 4 extra towels, 2 extra pillows and 3 extra blankets. Also, in each of the other rooms there were extra blankets. In the smaller room with the 2 beds, there was also a vacuum and iron and ironing board.Bathrooms - Very clean. In the master suite bathroom there was also a hair dryer.Washer Dryer - Clean and very efficient. We washed all of our clothes before leaving - and it was nice not to have to return home with dirty clothes.Park Destinations - VERY CLOSE. It took less than 10 minutes to get to the parks.Mall destinations - Close. It took about 20 min to get to the malls. Exit 72-Sandy Lake Road had lots of places to eat and shop.Supermarket - Very close.

The service staff might deserve more than the three stars we rated them but we had little need to visit them so we can't really say. We can certainly say that on the two occasions we went to them they responded positively and professionally. (Note to self - maybe tick the fourth star if I remember.) The pool area is kept clean, with no towels draped over empty loungers like in European resorts. Dave and Janet run a very friendly restaurant and bar with their staff of Darlene and Rob and I urge you to eat there during some of your stay. Any or all of them will drop by your table and shoot the breeze with you. The menu is a simple one but the food was always good. Always check out the specials too because Chef Rob loves a challenge and he hit the spot on all occasions we were there.

That is probably part of the problem with the complex. Most of the units receive heavy use by teenage boys and their chaperones and the condos and the complex are showing the wear and tear. The first unit we were assigned had filthy carpet and a very strong odor. I went back to the front office and basically had to force the lady working there to move us. She said they were booked up starting the next day and if I didn't take that condo, someone else would have to. I explained to her that that was not my problem. Finally someone from housekeeping came and agreed that the condo needed some work, so they moved us. The next one was marginally better, but at least didn't have the strong odor. Perhaps because of the large number of teenagers (the pool was a packed at night with kids), there was a lot of trash in the hallways that seemed to stay for days. If they are going to rent to a basketball tournament, they need to ramp up the cleaning staff. Also, for some reason, no one's cell phones got service inside the buildings. You have to go outside to the parking lot to make or receive a call. This is definitely not a place to be unless you have to for a tournament.

We had a 2 bedroom. We were told to expect a resort fee of around $20/day. Not true at all. We stayed 2 nights, so there was a 'mandatory' cleaning fee of $57. The rate is closer to $70 for a 3 bedroom, if you stay less than 5 nights.There is also a mandatory deposit of several hundred dollars or a non-refundable charge of $39 for insurance. I had not expected an extra $100+ charge for $75/night room.At check in, there is one woman at desk. So if there are people in front of you, get comfortable. She's the only there to deal with everyone. Our room was in the building the furthest away, which was nice, but the quality of the construction was much shoddier than it appeared from the outside. Our room view was of a sign saying something like 'no trespassing' and our other view was of all the air conditioning units. If you go, expect lots of families w/ rowdy children. Further, our A/C did not work. The maintainence guy determined it needed freon, but since it was the weekend, no one could help. He wasn't certified to add freon, so it would have to wait until after we left. The pool area was fairly nice. The kiddie pool was filthy and full of garbage and mulch. It also 'closed' very early compared to the larger pool. Overall, I wouldn't stay again.

We had a 2 bedroom condo by I4 and we could not hear any noise from either the road or other people. The staff was extremely nice and helpful any concerned that came up were handled within minutes. The thing to remember when booking this resort is that these are individual self service condo’s. This means there is not maid or room service and all cleaning is up to you. I like this because it makes it more like a home away from home. The washer and dryer made if very simple to keep clean linens and clothes and the full kitchen made it easy to have good meals without constantly having to spend the money to go out.

Had a really nice steak sandwich for lunch served by the pool. And my wife really enjoyed the pina coladas. My 5 year old boy spent hours in that pool and so did we!The condos have everything you would expect such as washer/dryer, TV in every room, DVD player, full kitchen. You need to buy everything though for the kitchen. All they give you is one small packet of dishwasher soap and a small bottle of liquid soap. There is a Publix supermarket a minute away and a Walmart about 10 minutes drive. The staff was friendly and acted quickly when I reported an issue with our DVD player.

All the staff were very friendly and helpful and responded promptly to any requests. A Publix and a Walgreens are both located about 5 minutes away so it was convenient to pick up anything we needed.The Resort is located just off I - 4 and it was easy to get to both the Magic Kingdom and Seaworld. Take exit 58 and head north about half a mile and turn left (just before the gates) at S Goodman Rd and the Resort is about another half mile. It's about 40 minutes from the airport which was also nice as we had an early morning flight.My only regret is that we did not have more time to spend there.Thanks to the staff for an amazing stay.,2009/05/06,2009/04/01,Traveled with family,,5,5,5,0,0,5,,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManitobaDoug,1,,man,,,1,,,,,,,,0,0,1,"Brandon, Manitoba",2009/05/01, 100 ,2,2019/01/02

Its location is only about 10 mins from the Disney parks, and about 15-20 to the Premium Outlets (you'll see them on your left when coming from the airport down to the Tuscana).YOU NEED A CAR IN ORLANDO ANYWAY, so I have no idea why people are WHINING about any distances.The area is very upscale (Champion's Gate) and I have no idea about any trailer park or whatever that other reviewer was talking about... they must have had time to search these out while driving all over the 'freakin' place ;-).The pool was plenty fine wrt size and towels are readily available (you just have to actually ask). You can also just bring a towel from your condo anyway.The staff was great to us - we showed up at around 11:30 (check-in is 4:00) and because the condo wasn't ready (I took a chance), they told us to grab our bathing suits and go for a swim while we waited - and YES - they gave me the 'elusive' towels to use.Beers on tap are Bud and Bud Light ($2.50) and they have about 6-7 beers by the bottle... didn't get any, so I don't know the price - Bud light is good enough to throw back when you're beside the pool anyway. The food is pub fare but the chef always has a really good special on for dinner for about 10-12 bucks (Meat/poultry, potatoes, veg, etc) and they have a child's menu for around $5.We had a three bedroom condo - it was fully stocked with all the kitchen items you can think of - they are there, just look. There is also a washer/dryer, ironing board and iron (why would you), TV in every room, fully controllable thermostat, two bathrooms (main and ensuite (ensuite has roman shower)) and everything was very clean when we showed up - even the toilet seats had those 'seat-sashes' letting you know that it was cleaned.I had purchased a 7-day Disney pass thingy and wished I hadn't. My daughter just wanted to stay at the Tuscana and swim with the other kids... and I HAD to just sit there, by the poolside, at 85 degrees, drinking beer... it was horrible... so I did it every night.Amenities - as you have read, there is a Publix (like a Sobey's for you Canucks) which is a grocery store... with lots of beer/frozen foods/ fresh foods/toiletries to purchase to stock your fridge - about a buck a beer, by the way. There is also a Chili's restaurant, a Walgreen's (pharmacy), a 7/11 w/gas, some bank, a SubWay (sandwiches, not the travel) and a few other little shops. the Publix has swimming accessories for sale (goggles, floaties, flippers, etc) and they are pretty cheap.There are 9 'complexes' on the resort and we were in building 2 on the first floor. We were originally slated for building 7 but it all depends on when you show up and what is ready at the time... so there's no point in asking ahead of time. We were at the far end of building 2 and the walk to the pool was a HUGE 28 second venture (again, more sarcasm to the 'frickin/freakin' people). the longest walk (from the furthest building) would be about 90 seconds... I know - bring the car.Well, I gotta go - there's lots more I want to say but the answer is YES - if you have children - come here. If you like sitting by the pool and having a cold beer whilst your kids are swimming - come here.REMEMBER: You are on vacation - LIGHTEN UP!.. and relax...",2009/04/13,2009/04/01,Traveled with family,7  ,5,4,5,0,0,5,,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/the_other_other_guy,140,2,man,,,5,11,,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,5,Ottawa,2009/04/01, 511 ,11,2019/01/02

It's extremely clean and the staff were very helpful. The pool area is great and while we were there it was pretty quiet during the day as most families were at the parks. It gets busy in the evening when they all return to cool off! There isnt much in the area but again adequate for a self catering holiday, with Walgreens, a Publix supermarket, 7/11 and a Chillis ( which does take out) at top of road before you drive up to resort. Nothing much else in the area but not an issue for us as we had a car - which if staying here is essential. Towels are provided for use by the pool, you just need to ask at reception. The resort is ideally located for visiting the parks as its just off the I4 and a few exits down from The Magic Kingdom. The reason I have deducted 2 points is that we had an incedent regarding trash. Guests are responsible for placing their trash in the dumpsters provided - which is fine and we did every day. BUT, one morning my husband went down to the car( we were on the 2nd floor so a 30 second run down steps) and when he came back about 2 mins later someone had left a large bag containing their trash outside OUR condo. Initially we didnt do anything about it as we thought maybe a cleaner had left it there to take away later. But it was still there when we got up the next day but some animals had got to it and it was spread all over the landing. My husband rang reception to report it and guess what they did? Came all the way over to our condo and left a snotty letter telling us we were responsible for removing out own rubbish and that we were being fined $25!!!!!!!! We were inside and had they knocked on the door the sitiation would have been cleared up immediately. We were quite angry at this stage so my husband rang again to clarify the situation and requested an apology but the person at reception just said it was a fair assumption that we had left it there!!!!! Eh hello, we rang to complain about it origionally and also if we were like that would we really leave our trash directly outside our own door???? I think not!! Ok rant over! Other reason for point dedution is the bar and restaurant was very disappointing. It is not a restaurant ( which was our understanding) but more like pub grub by the pool. And the drinks at bar and pool are very expensive and not good value for money. It's run by and English couple, who are lovely, but unfortunately they are giving English measures and over charging for them. Overall I would definitely return to the resort and would recommend it to others.",2009/04/09,2009/04/01,Traveled with family,2  ,5,3,4,0,0,5,,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aido07,7,2,woman,,,5,8,,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,22,ireland,2007/10/01, 853 ,12,2019/01/02

You've got a 711, Publix, Walgreens, and Chilis. Past that is frickin COW FIELDS!!! Directly adjacent to the property to the east is I-4. I mean ""I can hear what song every car is listening to"" close to I-4. To the west is a dirt road with nasty trailers. The place has a gate at the entrance. That's awesome except for one minor detail. THERE ARE NO FENCES! What good is a gate when a theif could walk 30 feet and be at my car anyways? Pool area is way too small and it was impossible to swim laps due to kids. Small hot tub only held 8 or so people and had freaking fire ants IN it.

We were not disappointed. The furnishings still look new, and the beds are still comfortable. Having 2 full bathrooms is great. We never had to go to a restaurant for breakfast, as thanks to the full kitchen with all the needed supplies we made a quick meal every morning. We went home with clean clothes, and packed lighter, thanks to having a full sized washer and dryer. Bring or buy dryer sheets, and a small bottle of detergent. You also will need to provide a few things like paper towel and toilet paper, as only 1 roll each is provided for you. The pool is excellent. The location is terrific, Close to Disney parks, and about 22 miles from the Orlando Airport. There is a restaurant and bar on site, we have never eaten there, and the drinks are pricey, We brought bottled water and fruit into the pool area, with no problems. Internet was available via ethernet for about 12 dollars a week, in the room, It is free in the clubhouse.

No grill or park/playground area in the resort. Close to Magic Kingdom (less then 10 min) and other attractions. This is Directly off of Highway 4, so easy to get on &amp; off (also might be noisy if you are in the last building closest to highway). Downfall: No free WiFi in the complex.

Less than half a mile away is a Chili's where you can walk to for diner of a few margaritas. 7-11 sells .02c a minute phone cards to call home. Walgreens is the cheapest place to buy cigarettes in the area, and Publix the grocery store is lovely and clean and lots to choose from. There is a liquor store next door to Publix and the bloke is lovely that owns it. As for the condo the only thing I would say is if your a light sleeper do not book a ground floor and go for the 4th floor there is an elevator to get you to the top. The walls are paper thin and so are the floors so if you have someone that walks hard of kids jumping up and down they sound like they will land in your living room 4th floor super quiet.The pool is wonderful with a hot tub, the bar area is run by a fellow Brit Dave and he is lovely. He does a good breakfast and lunch on the weekends. We met some great new friends and at night if you like to see nature you can catch a glimpse of the raccoon in the bin by the pool. Very funny!!! As for getting to everything like Disney, Sea World and shopping the resort is just off the motorway and a 5 min drive to Disney, 20 min from the airport and the shopping is easy to get to. I highly recommend going to the mall of Millennia as the outlets are good but still high street prices. At the mall you get better quality and newer styles at the same price.

It is a very peaceful area and at a great price, we do plan to go back next year. The area is so clean, the pool was very clean, I don't have anything bad to say about the place. I can care less about a 24 hour person at the front desk because when the office people were there they helped out a great deal.

Let me remind you that I was suppose to check in that afternoon at 2pm so I never called to inform them about us coming as late as we did. (That Was A Gamble) It was a very, very, very easy check in I have ever had in my life at any Hotels/Condo. It is close to all stores and if you have a car, Universal, Disney and all the other adventure parks are only 25 minutes away, which I thought was wonderful. As far as security goes every night we seen a security person driving the little carts around the area, because we was on the first floor so we really felt safe.

It seem strange with the golf course and the land available in this area why they choose to build some blocks less than a stone throw from the I4 and I therefore understand how noise could be an issue for those staying in these apeartmentsAccess to the resort is through a large gate and by punching in a four digit code given to you at reception when you arrive, there are no other sign of security not even a fences around the resort and therefore makes the gates seem rather pointless.The apartments are clean tide and well equipped except when it comes to the televisions there was one 21 inch and two 19 inch no HD and no Flat screen , if each condo was selling for 360,000 dollar in 2007 surely one could have been provide in the sale?There is no maid service except when you leave therefore cleaning the apartment , and clean bedding and towels etc are all down to you during your stay here,Although it would appear from my critic above I would be reluctant to return here nothing could be further from the truth, we both enjoyed our stay here , as it was quiet during our time here regardless of the I4, also it is well a way from usual tourist traps of International Drive and Kissimmee but is close enough to a Publix and few other shop for the day-to- day provision without having to venture on to the I4 with its east and west access very close to the resort Exit 58For those who wish to visit Disney Parks or Down Town Disney it is no more than a exit or two on the I4 east The pool is clean and tidy and the gym was quite well equipped also a pool towel is provided",2009/02/24,2009/02/01,Traveled as a couple,1  ,5,3,3,0,0,5,,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thebairns,77,2,,50-64,10,4,2,,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,14,"Falkirk, United Kingdom",2007/07/01, 702 ,11,2019/01/02

NO SUCH LUCK. When I walked into our 3 bedrm. suite, there were stains all over the carpet throughout. It looked like a child with a sippy cup went all over spilling his/her drink. Apparently the maid didn't notice. Also, the shower in the master bedroom was not clean. Someone else's hair was still on the floor. I reported both to the front desk and they told me that they would note the stains. When we returned from dinner the shower had been cleaned. Of course, I had bought cleaner and disinfected it myself prior to using. (Great vacation) The suites are actually very large and nicely set up. If the resort took the time for cleaning and maintenance, it would be a great resort. I got an awesome deal on this room so I cannot complain too much but I would have rather paid more and stayed elsewhere. The pool area is actually nice and does offer a bar and small cafe. This is the best part of the resort. However, this was listed as a 4 star resort on the site that I booked it. It would be lucky to receive a 2 star rating. I cannot believe that it is associated with Wyndham. I would only recommend this resort if people were going to stay in a regular room (Holiday Inn, Days Inn). They could pay the same amount here and get 2 or 3 bedrooms. Just bring your cleaning supplies and don't pay $150 or more cause it is NOT worth it.",2009/02/16,2009/02/01,Traveled with family,2  ,1,1,1,0,0,2,,3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jkelsh,12,1,woman,35-49,,4,9,,1,2,0,0,1,0,0,4,"Chazy, NY",2009/02/01, 414 ,9,2019/01/02

There were good and bad points. Let’s begin with the good ones. The resort is well located for Disney Parks, it takes a 10-15 minutes to drive there. There is a grocery, a drugstore, some restaurants nearby. If you need to go to Walmart or HomeDepot, you will have to drive 10 miles. The condo we rent was nice, clean and very spacious. The whole resort is very clean as well as the pool and the exercise room.The bad point is that it is very very noisy. The building is almost new but, as many others in Florida, is not really insulated, the structure is weak, the walls are thin – some of them are located directly along the I4 (the highway). Then you cannot rest. Sleeping at night is a challenge. The doors are not adjusted correctly, instead of closing they slam and when it does, all the building shakes (daytime as well as knight). It seems to be like that in all the resort, even in the office. The heat pumps are noisy and are installed directly under the bedrooms windows. Even when the windows are closed, you hear people talk, shout, have arguments. Early in the morning, you hear the laundry trucks, landscape tools, etc.We cannot say for other time of the year, but while we were there, it was the party all around and late at night. As the office is closed at night and there is no guardian, you cannot tell anybody. Then if you make a reservation at this resort, at least, ask to have an apart behind the building (as the parkings are in front) – it might be more quiet. Look at the resort plan to choose a building that is not too close from the I4.",2009/01/16,2008/12/01,Traveled as a couple,1  ,4,3,2,0,0,5,,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haileyusa,5,2,woman,35-49,10,4,5,,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,14,Québec,2008/09/01, 705 ,14,2019/01/02

Nous avons constaté de bons et de mauvais points. D’abord les bons : Le Resort est très bien situé par rapport à Disney, environ 10 minutes de route. Il y a une épicerie, une pharmacie et quelques restaurants à proximité. Le condo que nous avions loué était beau, propre et très spacieux. L’ensemble du Resort est très propre ainsi que la piscine et la salle d’exercices.Le point négatif, c’est que c’est très très bruyant. L’édifice est pratiquement neuf, mais comme bien d’autres bâtiments en Floride, ce n’est pas vraiment isolé, la structure est faible et les murs sont minces – quelques bâtiments sont situés juste à côté de la I4 (l’autoroute). Ainsi, vous ne pouvez pas vous reposer. Dormir la nuit est un défi. Les portes ne sont pas correctement ajustées; au lieu de fermer, elles claquent et quand ça se produit, c’est tout l’édifice qui tremble (le jour comme la nuit). Il semble que ce soit ainsi dans tout le Resort, même à l’accueil. Les thermopompes sont localisées juste en-dessous des fenêtres des chambres. Même quand les fenêtres sont fermées, on entend les gens parler, crier, se disputer. Très tôt le matin, on entend les camions de lessive, les outils d’entretien paysager, etc.Nous ne pouvons parler pour les autres temps de l’année, mais lorsque nous étions là, c’était le party tout autour. Comme l’accueil ferme la nuit et qu’il n’y a pas de gardien, on ne peut se référer à personne.Ainsi, si vous faites une réservation à ce Resort, demandez, au moins, une unité située à l’arrière de l’édifice (vu que le stationnement est situé à l’avant) – ça devrait être plus tranquille. Aussi, ce serait prudent de consulter le plan du Resort pour choisir un édifice situé le moins possible à proximité de la I4.",2009/01/09,2008/12/01,Traveled with family,2  ,5,,2,0,0,2,,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haileyusa,5,2,woman,35-49,10,4,5,,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,14,Québec,2008/09/01, 705 ,14,2019/01/02

Expedia hadn't yet done their part with getting reservations sent over, but staff took care of everything right away and they all were VERY nice and helpful. I' am surprised at reading the negative comments which is why I felt the need to comment on our recent experience. It is not ""secluded"", it is 1/2 mile from resturants, gas and shopping. Right next to interstate. The 1/2 mile road to Tuscana Resorts seems like you might be on a road to no where, but you come up to a gated very beautiful complex...WOW! We had a 2 bed/2 bath, just being there made it feel like you were home away from home. Bedrooms have huge walk in closets with tv's and their own very nice bathrooms. Full kitchen with all appliances, dining room with set table and smaller livingroom with chair, sleeper sofa, tv. Everything seemed brand new and CLEAN and we kept it that way. We felt it was extremely quiet, didn't notice the hwy sounds/traffic at all to us it was a nice relaxing change. Our rate was $89 per night, which is unbeliveable considering The Omni which is blocks away is a couple of hundred dollars per night for a regular room. Champions Gate is beautiful, Tuscana is right there...very nice and safe location absolutly no complaints. No offense, but for the hotels you see on the travel sites for under $75 you will pay for what you get. There was lots of ""dumps"" on this one main strip called Irol Bronson Hwy trust me what you see on the internet isn't always what you get. READ REVIEWS, I at first thought why not pay $40 per night we were not going to be in the room much...I' am sooo glad I read reviews and we decided to pay more, it was SO worth it! Also, get a rental car we have used Alamo in Orlando and Vegas with no problems. They are located in the airport, which beware some are not! Husbands softball team found out the hard way two months ago. First time going to Orlando, not impressed EVERYTHING is very spread out it wasn't what I thought it was going to be.

The room was lovely, very clean, well-maintained. All the comforts of home (3 TV's, 2 bathrooms, washing machine, tumble dryer, dish washer, microwave, cooker, toaster, coffee maker, blender, hairdryers, iron/ironing table, vacuum cleaner, extra bedding, blankets and pillows). Pool towels were also provided (you return them when you're checking out). The only problem we had was with the ""bugs"". There were LOADS of them (and I mean loads). My 3 year-old daughter was petrified so we couldn't actually sit at the pool at all. That is my only grumble and, to be fair, it's nothing to do with the apartments and can't be helped. The place was VERY easy to find, just off exit 58 of the I-4, turn right and you're there! It took about 25-30 minutes to get there from Orlando International Airport. It was a 10 minute drive to Disney and the 192. In addition to the Publix and Chili's, there's a Chinese restaurant, a Pizzeria, hairdressers, beauty parlour, off-licence, McDonalds (24 hours), Walgreens pharmacy (24 hours) and a couple of other shops. We didn't eat at the on-site restaurant so can't comment on whether the food's any good or not. Because it's right off the I-4, it's really easy to drive to places (and I would agree with previous posters that a car is a necessity but it would be a necessity wherever you stayed in Florida in my opinion). I would definitely recommend these apartments to anyone and, if I ever get enough money to go back to Florida, this is probably where I would stay.

We had a 2 bed condo which was clean and well maintained with all the homely comforts you needed. We got there late on the Sunday when reception closes at 18:00. But a helpful guy came out of the back office and helped us retrieve our envelope with the keys to the condo. He also opened up the gates for us and pointed us to our block. Anytime I went to reception I was met with a friendly face ( Veronica ) who was pleasant and helpful. The Tuscana was easy to find just off the I-4 on exit 58. As you exit the ramp keep right, turn right and right again between Chillies and 7 Eleven. Drive up the road and you can`t miss it as it is the only development there. People need to remember that these are apartments and not a hotel so those people complaining might have had their expectations set too high. Regardless these are great condos and well kept and nicely decorated and equipped. There is also a great swimming pool, gym and a business centre at reception with free interent access. For groceries there is a Publix ( Supermarket ) just up the road about 3 minutes drive. Disney is a junction up depending which way you go and ideal for family with kids. International drive is 20 minutes ( 1 of the 4 exits ) and for shopping, the Prime Outlets are just a 10 min drive on the I-4 toward Orlando.

Location of the resort was fairly central for all the attractions. Felt quite secure with gated access. On the downside there was no safety deposit box in condo which should be supplied. Another gripe was the towel service at the pool. Towels supplied at start of holiday to be washed in the condo and returned at end of holiday. A 10 dollar fine if you did not follow through these instructions. Every resort I have visited have provided clean fresh towels on a daily basis! Surely this service could be provided. Reception staff not paricularly friendly, one 'lady' in particular was very rude and abrupt! A big problem with holidaymakers dumping their garbage under the stairwell. Could be a potential health hazard and the management really need to address this problem. Big garbage containers at the end of the complex so there is no need for this to happen.

I travelled with my huband, daughter aged 7and friend. We booked holiday with holiday genie. We flew from Manchester to Atlanta, then Atlanta to Orlando, with Delta Airlne's, they are good but Virgin are much better, more freebies etc and children's goodies. Hired car with dollar. Drive from aiport is approx 30 mins, straight forward drive on 417 then I4 exit 58. Due to location limited restaurants and supermarkets, but if you have a car this is not an issue. The supermarket Publix has everything you need, but if you are prepared to drive to I Drive you will find the prices cheaper!!!! We stayed in block 3 on 1st Floor, everything was immaculate. Our accomodation consisted of 3 large bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, one with en-suite. Towels were supplied in the bathrooms plus lots more. Bed linen was top quality and the table was laid with crockery and wine glasses etc upon our arrival, which we thought was a nice touch! The pool was lovely and bar very cheap!!!! One evening my friend and I asked for a glass of white wine, we were given a pint of champagne!!!!!! There was everythng you needed a full kitchen, oven, microwave, fridge freezer with ice maker, hoover, iron, ironing board including a washing machine and tumble drier, this is the first holiday I have come home without dirty washing!!!! You are perfectly placed for disney approx 15 mins, resort also offers free shuttle to disney. Universal and Seaworld are about 30 mins drive, you can use shuttle at a cost of about $15.00 for a family. The reception staff were very helpful. The pool area was clean and safe.

I assume they have plans to build other condos in the next few years. You need a code to enter the gate but they do not have security or staff on site after hours except a 1-800 number. If you do call the number for anything - we were told to expect a 1 hour delay for any after hours calls. The pool was nice but there were creepy guys hanging around. One warm early evening 2 of them watched our young daughter like she was food and they had not eaten in weeks. It bothered us enough that we decided to leave the pool early. The 2 guys got up and started following us. We knew they were not staying on our block so I back tracked and subsquently checked out early. We did not feel safe. I had to pay for all nights of the stay as the fees are non-refundable. The condo was new, clean and had a washer and dryer in the unit. The location was close to a pharmacy, food, grocer, and a very quick exit to get on I4. To go to Disney expect 15-20 mins in traffic.

We were a young(ish!) couple and we were not warned beforehand as to how far away from everything we would be. When we arrived at the airport we had transfer services arranged but could not get on the normal bus as we were so far from everything. Turned out nice as we got a lovely chauffer driven Sudan to take us personally to the apartments, but even he kept commenting on the remoteness of our lcoation! We arrived during the day so had no problems with getting our key from the reception. They were friendly but seemed very unorganized (both at check in &amp; check out). They only work 8-9 during the week and 9-6 at weekends which make it difficult to get hold of them (as we were generally out all day and arrived back after they had finished). The apartment itself is lovely...large, fully equipped, comfortable and has everything you could possibly need. There is no way we can fault the apartment at all. Thankfully we picked our car up the next day which was a blessing as there is nothing to do in the area. It takes 2 mins to get onto the I-4 which is the main road to Disney/Universal/Kissimmee. Disney &amp; Kissimmee are only 15mins away, Universal 35mins. (NASA is approx 1.5-2 hrs away and well worth the drive! ) The problem is that if you want to go out for dinner and have a glass of wine etc at night one person always has to drive. We tried walking to Chilies at the end if the road but I would not recommend it - the road has no footpath and is unlit. Basically, as you drive down the I-4 our location is signposted as a service stop as it has a Chilies Diner (which is really nice), MacDonald’s, Supermarket &amp; 24 Gas station. Location aside our main disappointment of the trip was the pool bar. The pool area itself is gorgeous...plenty of beds, well kept etc. The pool bar however is run by incompetent, rude, bad mannered English Family which was a shame as we would have gone there most nights for a drink/dinner etc. They offered cocktails but could not actually make them, when I took one drink back and said it tasted nothing like a margarita she replied that she had followed the ingredients and then turned and walked off. They argued and lied about tips in front of us, lied about which chef was working when we asked them, and when I asked for a taxi number one night they basically said they couldn't help and again walked off. I would recommend Tuscana as the place itself is lovely, I just would not recommend it for young people who want to go out for dinner &amp; drinks on an evening and who don't want to spend all their holiday driving around.",2008/03/27,2008/03/01,Traveled as a couple,4  ,5,1,4,0,0,5,,1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louisehT1903EZ,101,3,woman,,,9,10,,4,4,1,0,0,0,0,17,UK,2006/05/01, 1070 ,12,2019/01/02

We first had to go to the Welcome Centre on the 192 to pick up the details and then drive about 20 minutes to the resort. The girls in the Welcome Center were very nice but we did have to wait till 4pm before we could be seen. When we did get to the resort checking in was fast and were in our apartment within 10 minutes. I wasn't expecting to much because of the low price but what a nice surprise, the apartment was brand new, big kitchen with everything you would need in a working kitchen. Both bedrooms were large with en suit, walk-in wardrooms and TVs. A large dinning room table that was full set on arrival. Also there was a sitting area and another TV, 3 Tvs in all. The whole apartment was nicely decorated, clean and very large and had everything you would need to run a household ( washer/dryer, dishwasher, full fridge, A/C, vacuum, brooms, dustpan and brush). There is no house keeping at this resort but if needed it could be ask for at a charge. The pool area was lovely with lots of sun lounger with a few umbrellas, you could rent out the large cabanas if needed and I think they were about $10 a day. The pool was a good size but not very deep. Most of the pool is only 3 feet deep and 4.5 feet at it's deepest.  There was some things that were a bit upsetting. On the first day we were told off for having our own drinks around the pool, this was a self catering holiday and I feel was a bit out of order. The hot tub never got warm the whole time we were there (10 days)and back at the apartment there wasn't any black out curtains, well no curtails at all really in the bedrooms so the bedrooms did light up early in the morning. Not great for a good sleep. The location wasn't bad about 20 minutes from Disney, 30 minutes from International Drive. The resort is on the I4 at junction 58. You will also find a Chillies, 7elven gas station, Publix supermarket and a few restaurants at the end of the road that runs from the resort. I would stay here again in a shot, for the price and the standard of accommodation it is excellent.

Plus it only goes at 8:30 am and picks you up at 5:30pm. Not convenient if you want to stay for the fireworks.

We stayed at the Tuscana Resort in Davenport Florida. This place is beautiful, it is located near Champions Gate, easy access to the interstate. I would say about 10 minutes to Disney and 20 minutes to Universal Studios, this is where we went(had an awesome time there.) My husband and I were celebrating our 25th anniversary with our two children. I booked directly through Tuscana with Robert Jimenez. He was great to deal with.Our unit was brand new, which I loved. I told Robert we wanted everything to be perfect for our anniversary. Boy, did he listen. When we opened our unit, he had a anniversary card for us, dove chocolates and a bottle of champagne. He also had the ice box stocked with eggs, sausage, orange juice, milk, butter and many other things. We were very impressed. We felt very pampered.I can’t say enough about the security guards that work there, they were awesome they were so nice, just about every time we came we would stop and talk to them. By the time we left it felt as if we made new friends. The entrance and grounds were very secured. My husband used the spa and my daughter used the pool, which they enjoyed very much. They also had a theater you could pop in a DVD and watch your favorite movie. I must not forget, right down the road is the publix market, McDonald’s,Chili's and other places to eat and shop. Tuscana is located in an awesome location.. We were having so much fun and I loved this place, I could have stayed and lived in our unit forever. So, if you looking for a new place, easy access to the parks and shopping Tuscana Resort is the place to be.

Been many times and will continue to ,UGGMerseyside,"We have been coming here since it opened I’d say around 3/4 years ago now. It’s still our favourite place to stay as it’s got everything we need and want as a family. We have stayed between 2-4 week each time. Andre at front desk is friendly, efficient and there’s nothing he won’t do for you. One thing I don’t like on reviews is if people say “oh this didn’t work, that was missing etc etc”. Call reception / Andre and ask for what you want fixing, replacing etc. These things are brought or fixed to you WITHIN MINUTES! It’s unfair to leave reviews complaining if you’ve never once brought it to someone’s attention. These guys genuinely want you to have a nice stay. The net at the front of one of the windows was missing. I like to open windows for an hour or two a day to get some “real air” (I’m from the uk! I like real fresh air at times not just air con! ). Within half an hour maintenance had fully fixed the window. No questions asked. Someone at the pool said their toaster was missing. I said have you asked... no.. I said so ask. A new one will be with you within minutes. I don’t get it. Please take a thought and if you have an issue call front desk and ask for it to be sorted. Not fair to complain after the fact. The site is excellent. Great pool. Lovely hottub. Yes there are some beds around the pool that are worse for wear but every day we were there and are here they are replacing furniture around the pool. New umbrellas. Two brand new gazebo’s for shade. The houses are great. Yes the staircase carpets etc do need deep clean regularly at times but they get so much traffic and maybe guests should have a little more respect and take off shoes in the house. Especially when going upstairs. You would do it in your own homes. If you can’t live with something on it, again, give them a call. They’ll sort it for you. No one wants to look at a horrid stain day in day out for weeks. This is an excellent place to stay. Decent price. Well kept site. Friendly helpful staff everywhere around, from front desk to house keeping to maintenance. This is very much a home from home for us and believe me I am mega fussy but these guys are wanting to do their best for you all round, especially Andre so stay without hesitation, because we will for years to come.

Lots of stairs to climb way up to the top floor, but the carpets were comfy and cozy.Advice: head out as soon as you can for groceries, including food, paper towels, toilet paper, and other toiletries. The resort supplies a starter set, but that will deplete fast if you have a big family. There is a Publix supermarket just up the road. No need to worry about towels ... lots provided.In summary, it's a nice big spacious place to ""live"" while you're on vacation. Your neighbors are connected to you, but the walls seemed quite sound-proof. Our neighbors had a big party and we weren't bothered, except by one person parking a car in our spot (they politely moved when asked). Our minivan did not fit in the garage, but a small car will, giving you space for another in the driveway, if needed.

We loved the four bedrooms and were delighted with the modern, ""newer"" look and feel of our condo. The one drawback would be the initial day of arrival. There is no signage to tell you to go to the Toscana to register to get into the gate at The Fountains--it is very confusing if you do not know this and there is no direction. A simple one or two signs along the road up to The Fountains or on the intercom box by the gate would be very helpful~ The staff are friendly and helpful.

All bedrooms were a great size, plenty of storage and comfy beds.Downstairs we had everything that we needed in the kitchen (which was a great size, modern and clean)Check in was smooth, staff were very pleasant and helpful and the amenities were spot on. The pool area is well maintained with ample space and the jacuzzi pool was a welcome relief after hours walking around the theme park. You have lots of local shops and eateries (which we made use of) The only thing that I would mention is that the lock on the sliding door in the lounge didn't seem overly secure but then the property is in a Gate secured resort which gave us peace of mind.As mentioned by a previous reviewer, we also experienced a raccoon in the trash bin area which was quite funny as we had never seen one before and my daughters thought it was great We've had another fantastic holiday in Orlando and without hesitation would stay at the The Fountains again if we were to return.

My daughter has special needs so I rely on hotels with full kitchens to prepare her meals. The kitchen was ill equipped (no knives, only two small pots). Check in was difficult. I had to return the next day between 8-11, which was hard because we had early morning Disney reservations at the Botique and I had to leave the park to complete check in, then return to the park after. It was time consuming and expensive to make the trip. We were given a complimentary upgrade to a 4 bedroom townhouse, but I was asked to then pay a cleaning fee of $120. I’d rather have had the 2 bedroom I booked.. my daughter and I were the only guests and I was not asked if the upgrade was okay. I would have declined. Additionally, I had to sleep upstairs in a smaller bed to be on the same floor as my daughter- the king size bed was downstairs, and two full size and two twin beds were upstairs. I went back to the office after check in because I wanted the room I had booked and was unaware I would be staying in a 4 bedroom townhouse, but they were closed. The hidden fees are the worst part, I booked online and it said fees may change but jumping $30 in the HOUR between when I booked and when I arrived? Sort of uncalled for, just be transparent and offer integrity pricing where you are honest with customers. Night one, our smoke detectors beeped nonstop. I don’t like to disable smoke detectors but the front desk did not answer my calls. Nobody provided WiFi information.

Encontramos a casa exatamente como nas fotos (nossa casa era a número 8127). Possui todos os itens e utensílios necessários para preparar algumas refeições e também material de limpeza e higiene para os primeiros dias. Havia toalhas em número suficiente para o número de hóspedes indicado no momento da reserva (reservamos pelo Booking.com e o pagamos o total no momento do check in em cash) e nós mesmos somos responsáveis por lavá-las durante a estadia. A casa é maravilhosa! Possui 2 andares, sendo duas suítes king (uma fica no andar inferior) com box de vidro, um quarto queen, um quarto com duas camas de solteiro, um banheiro social com banheira e cortina de plástico. Todos os quartos com closet e cabides. Tem lavabo no piso inferior, closet para mantimentos, lavadora/secadora de roupas e pratos, tábua e ferro de passar, secador de cabelo, garagem coberta para um carro (pode estacionar outro carro em frente à garagem e também em algumas vagas do condomínio). O cofre fica no closet da suíte do andar inferior. O lixo pode ser colocado no contêiner do condomínio em qualquer horário (achei ótimo isso pois em alguns condomínios é preciso obedecer dias e horários estabelecidos). O condomínio é lindo e bem cuidado. É novo, então, torna a estadia muito agradável. Não deu tempo de usar as piscinas, academia ou pegar filme para assistir. O check in (as 16:00h, mas chegamos por volta das 13:30 e a casa já estava disponível, sem problemas) e o check out (as 11:00 h, sendo que 15 min antes a responsável pela limpeza tocou a campainha, porém já estávamos prontos para sair) é realizado no condomínio ao lado, o Tuscana Resort e lá você recebe senha para o portão de entrada e cartões para a porta da sala. Fica perto dos parques da Disney e distante de Orlando uns 25 min, dependendo do trânsito. Isso não nos incomodou pois estávamos de carro e já sabíamos que seria desta forma. Muito perto tem posto de gasolina, farmácia Walgreens, supermercado Publix, restaurante Chillis, lanchonete Wendys, Red Robin (hambúrguer gourmet com refil de batata frita), McDonald’s e muitas outras opções de comércio. Alguns detalhes como por exemplo, a falta de uma iluminação mais forte sobre a pia do banheiro e acessório para pendurar toalha de rosto em alguns deles, o fato da água do chuveiro não esquentar muito quando mais pessoas tomavam banho ao mesmo tempo e a persiana da varanda da sala estar com algumas lâminas se soltando não nos causou nenhum transtorno considerável, pois no geral tudo funcionou perfeitamente e passamos momentos agradáveis durante nossa estadia. Sabíamos que não contava com limpeza diária, mas era isso mesmo que queríamos, conforto e privacidade! Enfim, decidimos por nos hospedar neste condomínio após ler a opinião positiva da maioria dos leitores, e realmente, ficamos muito satisfeitos com a escolha. Recomendo para famílias e grupos de amigos que preferem se hospedar com o conforto que a estrutura de uma residência como esta pode proporcionar sem se importar em executar pequenas tarefas domésticas e realizar maiores deslocamentos para acessar alguns pontos turísticos e as principais atrações.

Check in was short and sweet and a little short on customer care skills from the guy that dealt with us at the Tuscana resort next door and another encounter with a lady on reception was poor as i was greeted with not a hello as you would expect but card, she wanted my credit card as she thought i had come to check in when infact i had come to collect a parcel. Home was a spacious modern home with all the amenities with nice out look onto lake but on closer inspection once we had spent a number of days in the house we noticed it had some issues. Sliding patio door did not lock, blind to same door jammed and slat broken, furniture tops marked from wear, walls and paint work in need of repair. For a property that is not that old, it was showing its age in places. Did report issues at reception but blind and door still needed fixing when we left. On a more positive note, pools both at the Fountains and Tuscana are lovely with towels available free at poolside. Grounds are well kept and nice setting. Close to I4 and decent choice of fast food, restaurants and food stores etc just at the end of the road. In summary, nice place but i found myself a little disappointed, was expecting quality of home and attitude of reception staff to be better as i have stayed in Tuscana before and had better experience s.",2017/11/12,2017/10/01,Traveled with family,1  ,,,,1,1,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/607steveni,8,3,,,1,10,3,,0,6,4,0,0,0,0,11,,2014/08/01, 1033 ,13,2019/01/02

We stayed in a 3 bed town house which looked quite small on the outside, however we were pleasantly surprised when we entered. It's large and spacious with modern decor. The kitchen and bathrooms were all sparkling clean although the beige carpet on the upper floor and large rug in the living area really needed a carpet shampoo. The ground floor is all tiled and also could have been cleaner, this aside it really is a lovely place to stay. The bedrooms are all really large and comfortable, and it's a very quiet peaceful area. The local pub/ restaurant Millers is only 5 mins walk away and was the best food we had overall and was very reasonable. Publix is a 10 min walk and also a chemist, fish and chip shop, subway, dunkin donuts.This is a gated community so feels very safe, however the rear of the properties are not enclosed so not suitable for small children, and a couple of lakes with signs saying beware of alligators!!

The resort is gated, which makes you feel very secure. All the rooms were immaculate and modern. There was 6 adults sharing one of these townhouses, and we didn't feel like we were all on top of each other at all as the house and rooms are spacious. Netflix is on the TV in the lounge which was good for of a night. The pool (both smaller and the main) were lovely and modern, lots of sun loungers and only a small walk from the townhouse. We were caught up in Hurricane Irma, and although we were lucky to avoid any damage or real issues, we were stuck as we were due to depart the day the hurricane hit Florida. Fountain's allowed us to stay on an extra 2 nights without any hassle at all. While we were in the pool the day before, a lovely gentleman came and reassured us about the hurricane and gave us a print out with some tips and guidance which was very appreciated with us never experiencing anything like it before. During the hurricane our alarms tripped and an engineer was with us within minutes to fix them at 2am. The location was ideal, 10 minutes to Disney and only about 20 to Universal. 2 minute walk away from 7/11 garage, Millers, Chillies, Publix and Dunkin Doughnuts as well as many other shops.

The pictures were beautiful! However, this is not what I was expecting. This is NOT a resort. The units are off a parking lot so don't expect a whole lot of landscaping or shade. These townhouses are for sale. They are most likely being rented out through a company till they sell the units. So a unit you rent will most likely have a for sale sign out front and/or one in the window. That's not a big deal. What is a big deal is the lack of care these units get. The kitchen faucet was broken. I could literally pull the whole faucet off the counter top. The water still ran so I just sucked it up and and decided to just make do. The back patio is open. No screen, no grill, no table, no chairs, only one lounge chair. That's it. The carpet was dirty, they AC stopped working, the dryer didn't work (it took two cycles to dry a load of clothes), lack of kitchen utensils/pots/pans, chipped dishes, the television stations quality looked like it was from the 80's, dead bug juice on the walls......I mean the list could go on. You could tell all the furniture in the unit was rented and old. Just rubbing my legs on the legs of the kitchen chairs left brown stains on my skin. The beds were horrible and squeaky.

It was nice, however, i did notice stains in the carpet, mostly going up the stairs, as well as, some stains in the carpet of upstairs and in each of the bedrooms. The bathrooms upstairs were clean, but I noticed crumbs or something on the floor of the half bath downstairs. The twin beds were really loud. Every time I shifted, the bed made noise. Not only that, but the headboard banged against the wall no matter what. Just sitting on it would cause the headboard to hit the wall. For the bed I slept in, I shoved a pillow between the wall and the headboard to keep it from banging against the wall. The other twin bed was used for my luggage, etc. and that bed was the same as the bed I slept in, loud. I couldn't imagine having someone sleep in the room with me and hearing their bed squeak and the headboard hit the wall every night just from turning over or getting up. Also, the railing going up the stairs was wobbly. I noticed it wasn't screwed in to the wall well. I also noticed the railing once you got upstairs was wobbly. I refrained from touching either for fear they would break. The living room area was very clean, the couches were comfortable and clean and the HD TV was amazing. The dishwasher wasn't draining the water inside so someone had to come fix it. Also, the alarm system kept chiming every so often. Couldn't be heard upstairs which was great. One morning, the kitchen lights and wifi went out unexpectedly and it wasn't until my father messed with the box in the garage that everything turned back on. I will say that there should be policies and consequences for guests and/or residents who are inconsiderate of others staying in this gated community. The first night here, a huge transit bus was stopped just in front of the driveway of the townhouse my family was staying in. My father had to ask the driver to move up. Mind you, every single night and morning, this bus pulled up in front of the driveway, blocking our vehicle in. If we wanted to go anywhere around 10am, too bad because that bus was always boarding people right there and stayed for at least 30 minutes if not longer. Every night, I had trouble getting any sleep because the bus would drop off all of these people and they would run around like chickens with their heads cut off laughing and playing in the street at 12AM-3 AM! Running back and forth down the street and into the townhouse next door and townhouses down the street and across the street. I mean there were multiple buses passing the bus in front of our townhouse, letting off dozens of people. Absolutely no consideration for others. Doors were slamming, people were screaming. It was like this EVERY night. My dad had to go make a complaint and they said security would take care of it and that other people complained about the same thing!! Out of all of those nights, i witnessed a security guy stop by the townhouse next door with teenagers out front speaking to them. I believe he was telling them to be quiet. Hell, he could've been conversing because once he left, they were back at it. Another note: these buses weren't even supposed to be coming through the gate and that's coming from front desk. One night I looked outside, and I saw a group of these people standing in our driveway behind our vehicle doing god knows what, laughing and talking and such. The day we left, my father was loading our things and he noticed someone had used their finger to write on the back of the truck. Funny thing, the day we left was the day they looked like they were leaving. They ruined the experience of this place. Not sure if i'll stay here again.

This place is awful!!!!! We are in Orlando for a baseball tournament, and this was one of the accommodations listed by the tournament to stay. Clearly the person recommending has never stayed here! The management staff is not helpful at all, and show no compassion or care for the issues that have come up. Here are those issues:*The carpet is old and dirty, walls are dirty, and bedroom furniture is all dinged up and paint peeling.*We were never given a garage door opener. When I told the front desk mid-week that I couldn't find it, they said, ""oh we should have given that to you when you checked in.""*Lights are blown out in the master vanity. I asked twice if they could be replaced. Both times I was told they would, but only one of the blown out lights was fixed. it's very dim.*The dryer barely works.*The gate to get into the complex was not working. There was a line of cars waiting to get in at 10:30 last night. The only way we got in was when a car left.*The air conditioning is weird. Even if it is set at 67 degrees, the downstairs is still very hot!*The pool has been so busy, we cannot swim. One day there was huge group in the pool (I'm talking 40-ish people), and they just stood in the middle talking. It was impossible for us to even move around in the water or swim.*The gym does not open early. This is my biggest issue! I workout 6 days a week, and needed to get my training in early each day before leaving for the baseball games. I went to the gym the first morning at 5:15am, tried to use my keycard, but the door would not open. There was a security guard walking around outside who told me the gym does not open until 8:00, and that I should go back to bed and come back at 8:00. Jerk! I did a workout outside that day, only to be hounded by dirty raccoons eating the garbage that people left outside. I called the front desk and they said, the gym at the main office opens at 7:00 if I want to use that the next day. I explained that it was too late, but again, no one really cared. I worked out outside the next two days, only to be chased by dogs, and bit in the face by fire ants while doing push-ups. Finally today, I went to the main office gym at 7:10, to find it closed. A security guard at that office told me that the gyms are supposed to open at 5:00am. What? Finally a person showed up to open the gym, and guess what? There was a guy in there working out!! I said to the girl, how did he get in? She said ""I don't know. If you want, we can let you in early too."" OMG!!!! I have been asking for that all week!!!!! This place is a joke! I will never recommend it to anyone!!!",2017/08/11,2017/08/01,Traveled with friends,2  ,3,1,,0,0,,2,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndreaW150,8,3,,,,11,16,,4,0,0,1,6,0,0,11,"Zionsville, Indiana",2012/05/01, 1121 ,16,2019/01/02

There are two pool areas, one for the townhouses and a main pool area with poolside cabanas which appears to be available to everyone in the resort. Both are very pleasant, and were never too busy. We did not try the restaurant in the resort as there was so much choice elsewhere. We were around 20 minutes drive to Disney and around 40 minutes to Universal. There were shopping outlets along the way. There is a Millers Ale House, Red Robin and Chili's within walking distance, also McDonalds, Subway, a pizzeria, 7-11, Publix and Walgreens all in the same area. Across the road were more eateries, including Wendy's. The staff were pleasant, although not overly interested or keen to promote the facilities.

The 3 bedroom condo is spacious and very nicely appointed. Granite/ stainless, etc. the pool is awesome and heated. Location is decent. A few major major qualms (and reading the other reviews I am not the only one who has felt this way). At check in I was hit with $113 in fees. I had already prepaid for the room and did not expect any charges at check in. Let alone these exorbitant fees for a 1 night stay. I travel often and I do read the listings. These fees are not prominently mentioned anywhere... they are indeed hidden. I would not have chosen this property had I known of the fees. In addition my check in was comically slow. It literally took over an hour. The keys didn't work, back to the main building, new keys didn't work, back to the main building, ""we'll send maintenance"" wait for maintenance for 20 minutes for him to look at the door and say ""the locks don't work just get the garage door opener and enter through the garage"" back to the main building get the garage door opener and finally get in. Over an hour and there was no line when we got there to check in!Also mentioned in a previous review was that it is hard to find. The property commented back that they never get that complaint. Let me go on record as agreeing with the guest... the property and check in area is VERY hard to find if you've never been there. Nice property, but a lot of improvements to be made, and ultimately there is no excuse for hidden fees which are dubious at best.

Nice and clean and brand new. A few things to be aware of: ac is on 2nd floor as a result all the cold air is pushed out on 2nd floor while the master ac has bad air flow. Thus, everyone on 2nd floor freezes while master first floor sweats. Also the master bed room door has one door knob with a lock but no other door knob so you can't lock the door for privacy. Not sure if they are all like this but management might want to make this a working door lock. Master bed floor bathroom shower also doesn't have strong hotel water flow but I think that's the nature of the beast. Besides these issues I would certainly stay again with my family of 6. It would be nice if a hose was kept in garage for those who have own cars to wash since a faucet is outside. You can get a garage door clicker from front desk which is nice. One bad thing about the garage door is that it sounds worse then a freight train when opening or closing.

We stayed at the Fountains. Everything you need from a home away from home. Absolutely not one complaint. The washer and dryer was perfect. Didn't need to over pack. The drive to Universal is about 25 minutes. Shopping and eating was practically in the backyard. Highly recommended if your looking for a luxurious Villa. I'm a bargain hunter myself and after researching for several weeks, the Fountains provided the most for your buck. The hot tubs at the end of a long day in the parks was the best part of our trip.

However, after further research with cleanliness and additional space we decided to upgrade before traveling and contacted the Aston Group via email for an upgrade, receiving a prompt reply. I would advise travellers to contact the Aston Group rather than amending with a travel agent as additional fees are normally added when involving a third party.The staff at the resort were excellent in terms of providing providing information, along with the maintenance acting professional and very polite. The air conditioning had a few issues which maintenance were aware of but we didn't even notice up on arrival and the staff fixed within minutes along with a blind with a missing panel and this was also fixed immediately.The accommodation was to a high standard, open plan living area and W/C along with access on the garage which could be locked from the inside for more security and the patio doors had locks to the screening too which is a plus if you have children and don't want to open the patio door for safety. The main reason why I comment on safety is the Alligator in the lake which we noticed sunbathed on the bank and as there is NO gate or fencing between the Alligator(s) and the people sunbathing on the patio area technically the Alligator could have easily walked on our patio area and entered the villa through the patio doors. However, after speaking with many local residentants in Orlando they advised us Alligator have a tendency to keep aware from people and I believe this to be case with the Alligator in the lake as overtime we opened the patio door when this on the bank approximately 6ft away from the patio area/patio door he/she would jump back into the lake and kept himself to himself but and I stress BUT I don't think for one moment I would leave my children on the patio and they are 15 years old and 8 years old as my Husband and I noticed the Alligator looking at our Son probably due to his small frame. (So parents, beware)!!!Apart from the Alligator issue and he wasn't very big approximately 4ft considering the size of some of them in Orlando but enough to harm someone I suppose if he wasn't to shy and then again, it depends where the villa's are located as ours was obviously backing onto the lake where the three fountains are. However, some villas backed onto woodlands and what seemed like a car park maybe with a small garden. I would like to point out that there could have been more sitting areas on the patio rather than just one sun lounger but I imagine this might be a deterrent to prevent people sunbathing with Alligators present. Again, there are signs stating do not feed the Alligator(s) so again, families please do advised to safe guard children, especially considering what happened this year with that poor little boy.Overall the complex is lovely and well kept to a high standard, having two good sized swimming pools, one at The Fountains and the other having access to the Tuscana Resort pool with nice sunbathing facilities and a bar at the Tuscana Resort with a restaurant too.The Fountains reception area before entering the pool area has a small gym, dining facilities for self-catering (no service) and plenty of sitting areas for both adults and children with TV's and games etc.Additional charges for cleaning are available and a charge per day was mandatory for access of maintenance and Playstation games, TV etc. All the bedrooms were relatively large with en-suite his and hers sinks and the children were of a good size too with plenty of storage, walk in wardrobes and plenty of room for hanging of clothes and suitcases, which is important as you don't want to be falling over your suitcases, especially when you are staying for a long period like we did (3 weeks). Overall, the villa was pretty much a home to home feeling and we loved the space. The villa we had was a 3 bed but they do have 4 beds too I believe and if I must say so well worth upgrading from a condo to a villa for additional space, along with luxury of course as these relatively new homes to a high spec. Perfect for a family with teenagers - children and parents who need there own space after spending long periods of the day together and want their own time less arguments and more happy memories in our case anyway!!Champions Gate is minutes from restaurants, Walgreens and the super market and a short drive from Celebration which is a must as such a lovely place, international drive is approximately 10-15 minutes by car and Disney 20 minute drive and probably the same distance but the other direction for Universal.My Family and I would recommend and have done as this provides a relaxing environment have such a hectic day at the parks sunbathing and plenty of space for a good sized family, rather than being couped up in a small space, like some hotels or complex's and well worth upgrading as opposed to staying at the Tuscana Resort as most of the condos are quite dated when comparing with one of the villas.We are returning to Orlando 2017 staying at Disney's Floridian Hotel but will be returning to this complex probably 2018-2019 primarily due to excellent service, accommodation and a spacious, relaxing environment.

All bedrooms are on the second floor so if you do have a toddler you will want to get the knobs to prohibit them from escaping their room and falling down the stairs. You will also need to bring or rent a high chair or pac-n-play for sleeping. These items are not made available from the facility. And, lots of glass, EVERYWHERE. TVs not attached to wall, tables, side tables, dinnerware, no plastic at all. There is a very small playground but at the farthest point of the adjoining resort.On the good side, the units are beautifully decorated unless you are a little on the hefty side. The dining room chair legs had to be rescrewed several times. For your toddler, you can use the garage for a playroom if you find a way to keep it away from the water heater.On the bad side, the units were not built to last so if you're thinking about a purchase here, make sure you get it inspected. One lounge chair and one chair per unit is unacceptable for a six to eight person unit. There was no table or even side table for what was there. An extension of the very small porch area would make for a more comfortable outdoor experience. We had unit 8107. It was close to the pool and clubhouse.

Championsgate is it's own community. You have Publix supermarket within walking distance, along with a walgreens, dunkin donuts, McDonalds, a pizzeria, and Chili's Restaurant. They are developing 2 more restaurants currently. Once of which that looks like it will be opening soon. A red robim and miller ale house. It is not a hotel, but a townhouse. We stayed in a 3 bedroom 2 1/2 bath townhouse. It includes, a washer and dryer, full kitchen, utensils, living room with flat screen tv, and tvs in each bedroom. The master bedroom has a queen bed with a small walk-in closet and his/her sink in the bathroom. The other bedroom has a full and the 3rd bedroom has 2 twin beds all on the top floor. There is an additional bathroom on the top floor for the other 2 bedrooms to share. There is a half bath downstairs. This place also comes with free wifi, free movie rentals and free video game rentals - place comes with sony playstation. They have a movie kiosk in the main lobby area and another in the pool area of Fountains. The main lobby is in Tuscana - where you check in. This is very confusing, only issue we had. We didn't arrive to the location until 11:00pm and the GPS kept taking us to another location. So, if you are checking in remember to put in the GPS the Tuscana Resort location. This is where the check-in and main lobby is. This is not like a hotel that you get cleaning services and change of towels, extra toilet paper, and etc. everyday. There is a fee for those services and any additional items you may need. We went to the Publix down the street and purchased toilet paper, paper towels, etc. And if you need clean towels you have to wash them yourself. It is basically, renting a town house or condo for the week. There is a one time cleaning fee at the end of you stay, it is billed at the end of your stay.Now about the property, it is very clean. Stainless steel appliances and well maintained. However, I don't think the property is that old, Tuscana is older. So, for 2 years old it is very clean and very nice. It is gated and you will need a pass code and pass card to go in and out of the property - we felt very secure. If you are going to Disney or Universal Studios, it is only a 10-15min car drive depending on traffic. So, ideal for families or large groups. The pool area is perfect, not a huge pool but a nice pool. This is where the gym is located and the movie room is located. You can make arrangements to rent out the movie room for the night, and it is free. Nothing bad to say about this place, I would stay here again. It is near a lot of places, walking distance too, great clean rooms, large space, secure and safe location, and close to all theme parks.Only thing that was a disappointment was that when we called to make reservations and had questions about the room sizes and bathroom. We were told that a half bathroom is not really a half-bath since it has a shower. Guess what that was not true, it was really a half-bath (toilet and sink). We actually need the extra shower, but we made this work. We would have rented the large 4 bedroom, if we knew this. Also, for anyone that goes again or stays here, supposedly all the townhouses are different. Not all 3 bedrooms are the same nor are the 4 bedrooms.

The place looked deserted and we finally left to find a place with respect for customers and hospitality. Booking.com was a good help with this. Never this place again.

The house is provided with a couple garbage bags and dishwasher tablets,toilet paper, and paper towels.

We found The Fountains at ChampionsGate with a bit of an internet search. Perhaps saying that it is in Davenport can be a bit confusing, but it is really just a few short miles from the major attractions in Orlando. In addition, the property is immediately off from Interstate 4 and easy to find.Checking in was painless and we were given the security code for the gate - assuring that there was indeed a nice level of security. The properties are actually condos built in townhouse style - 2 units with a common wall. I think were actually the first tenant for the particular unit we were assigned.Three bedrooms upstairs, one king with an attached full bath, one queen and a room with two single beds. The queen and singles share another full bath. The upstairs is spacious - with the access not a narrow aisle but rather a nice open space that also features a clothes washer and dryer, ample storage and more storage. The layout is well thought out and makes every practical use of space.Downstairs, coming in the front door, you are greeted to a nice combo living room space with a dining area that was well appointed. Then the full kitchen - a small island for prep area, dishwasher, full size fridge and freezer with ice maker. Just off the kitchen is the master suite - huge area - brilliant master bath with a huge shower, enclosed toilet and a huge closet that has a built-in digital safe typical to many hotels.Around the corner and in almost every nook, you find a door leading to more storage - noting is wasted. Also around the corner from the Master suite is a spacious half-bath. Every area was supplied with soaps and shampoos as required, plenty of towels and wash cloths. Finally, the last door on the bottom floor leads to a singe car garage that also houses the water heater.There is (reasonably) secure Wi-Fi in the condo specific to the each section. Televisions and entertainment are in every room. Again, we think we were the very first occupants for our meeting/party as everything appeared unused and there were the typical stickers on the oven and such saying not to be removed except by owner.The kitchen was fully equipped, with cork screw and even a cheese grater. There was an empty pair of salt and pepper shakers, assuming someone would fill them. We just bought a quick salt and pepper combo at the nearby Publix market. Nearby means a quick walk... perhaps 3-5 minutes at the most or a back passage way so you do not have to enter the main traffic area. There is a Walgreen's drug store, a few fast food places, a few restaurants, a liquor store that featured a well informed and amiable clerk/owner (?) that was a delight to talk with while picking out a few items.Overrall it was a great stay, perfectly laid out, complete, nice level of quality and painless check-in check-out experience.The ONLY thing we might say is a down side is that being so close to Interstate 4, the traffic noise can be a bit noticeable at 4-5AMish, but if you have been at the theme park attractions all day long, you will probably be too tired to notice.We plan to use it again!",2015/10/24,2015/10/01,Traveled on business,1  ,5,5,,0,0,5,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbd_mj,390,6,,,,196,75,Art and Architecture Lover,82,71,40,8,0,0,0,201,"Orlando, Florida",2011/05/01, 20185 ,47,2019/01/02

It's great! The houses are all newly built, and our 3-bed house was really spacious and well appointed - furniture is really nice, kitchen is great and beds really comfortable. Flat screen TV's in each room too, which was good, and we had a great view of the Fountains too! Everything is quite contemporary and on trend. The house also had a Blu-ray player and good wifi connection.The resort is now complete, but still very new so was very quiet when we were there - we had the use of the gym in the clubhouse and the pool (which is spectacular) and spa to ourselves almost the whole time. The Fountains is linked to the Tuscana resort that is a short walk away, and there's a good pool there which is a little busier with a decent bar and restaurant too.Great location for Disney (it's about 10 minutes along the I-4) as well as International Drive, Kissimmee and LEGOLAND. Championsgate has good local amenities - supermarket, restaurants etc are a 5 minute walk/1 minute drive.Only comment I would make is that the Clubhouse is a lovely building, but it's currently got nothing in much of it - would be good if they could make something more of it so that it has a use. Maybe they'll do that once it gets busier.All in all, a great new place to stay on our Central Florida visits.",2015/09/15,2015/09/01,Traveled as a couple,4  ,,5,,0,0,,5,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R6653ETscottc,109,1,man,35-49,,3,4,Foodie,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,"London, United Kingdom",2008/05/01, 304 ,9,2019/01/02

We stayed in a 5 bedroom home on Archfeld through Magical Memories. Obviously the specifics of each unit and its condition will vary with the ownership and rental arrangement so I will try to keep my comments focused on the overall area. The location is great. It is an easy drive to most Disney properties and just a short trek up to Irlo Bronson Blvd for groceries, Target &amp; Walmart. The property is immaculately maintained and houses are separate enough to not have sound issues when inside. No one seems to ever be outside except to jog or sit by their pool so it does have a bit of a stepford surrealism. The property does not have an onsite spa / salon. It does have a lovely pirate themed play structure and park, as well as a common pool with water slides. The area does not have any internal trolly / shuttle service nor does it offer shuttles to the parks so you will need a car unless you plan to stay in and don't mind walking 2-4 kms to get to the common pool or groceries. In part because of the private backyard pool and in part because of the distance we never actually made it to the main pool area. The property size and private pool made it ideal for a family rental. We did however have serious issues with the pool. Apparently because of noise the pools are only permitted to circulate between certain hours. These don't include any hours prior to 9 am, or after 10 pm. There also appears to be a chunk mid day until about 6pm but we couldn't quite figure it out. Without the pool circulating it doesn't heat. Generally speaking the temperature was around 73 F without heating - but that was with an air temperature over 30 C most days. The hot tub is also directly on the same system as the pool. Basically the hot water enters the hot tub and then flows over into the pool to heat it. However with the limited circulating hours which are centrally controlled for the resort, it is impossible to actually have the hot tub be hot outside of a 7-9pm window, and even then it's only about 95F. Also despite the noise rules over the pool motor, the neighbours had no problem having their outdoor tvs on well into the late evening, and with a whole double row of pools filling backyards the sound definitely carries.",2018/11/16,2018/11/01,Traveled with family,,3,,,0,0,4,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathleenM45,33,4,woman,25-34,4,34,37,,11,9,8,5,1,0,0,42,"Ottawa, Canada",2011/08/01, 3637 ,25,2019/01/02

Stayed two weeks just before Easter and left on Easter Tuesday. Accommodation ( townhouse) was booked independently and was extremely close to clubhouse and pool area. We would definitely stay again if we return to Florida. Overall I gave 4 out of 5 Windsor Hills a 4 out of 5 . Only two reasons why I didn’t give 5 out of 5: 1. New slides not open for Easter - one of the busiest periods2.

We chose Malaquita House Champions Gate which we learned wasn't in Champion's Gate. Three days before we left Canada we received an email from all vacation group stating they had relocated us to Windsor Hills. I had spoke to the manager and she assured me this wouldn't happen, She ;lied, Told we were getting an upgrade we arrived to a house that had not been rented in some time. You could tell the horrible smell of the water, the COCKRAOCHES and BROKEN POOL. I don't want this to happen to anyone else. We booked through booking.com then received an 8 ish page contract and no refund. There is no transparency they are con artists. Booking did not help either. We called and emailed for the first three days of our trip with no resolution. The Manager of All Vacation Group is so nasty and spoke down to me when clearly had difficulty speaking English. She laughed at me on the phone when I was asking why the pool was only heated for 6 hours a day. They charged me 37 USD per day for pool heat and won't refund when we did not heat until the last day. They also charged me $135 USD for using my VISA. Booking.com only responded to say they reached out and were told that the issues were resolved and they were not. It is a real shame as Windsor Hills is a nice resort but this house should be condemned. I should also mentioned we paid close to $3000 Canadian for the house.

We love it here, and feel that it is a value! Condo was huge, and had deluxe amenities. Location, again great. Fancy high end place. Main club house pool was awesome too. The only obvious flaw I found, was the pool heat at the house was extremely inconsistent. The day we arrived it was warmer than it necessarily should be. Two days later it was too cold to swim in. Called maintenance, adjustments were made, oh and more cold water was added from the hose.? Pool remaind cold for the rest of the stay. That being said, with so many other things to do, and with the main pool so close, this was a minor flaw.

We were blessed with amazing weather in the 80s every day. We rented a 3 bedroom townhouse with a dip pool. Units are rented through the Windsor Hills web site, VRBO and various other private rental companies. Our unit was very clean and spacious. The pool was heated to the perfect temp-not too hot and not too cold around 85. The kitchen had everything we needed, although salt and pepper and sugar would have been nice to have available. The bedding in our unit was pretty worn, but clean. Everything was in working order. My only complaint was we would have enjoyed some pool toys or floats for the kids. We used a grocery delivery service with no issues...don’t forget trash bags because there are none provided. We loved having the washer and dryer in unit. The thermostat was pre-programmed for the AC to run only to 76* we felt that was a little warm-but not a deal breaker for us since we were not in the unit that much.  We had no issues getting in and out of the front gate-if you use Uber or a local taxi service they will need to show their ID. The resort is meticulous and well maintained. There were separate areas, larger homes by the playground further out on the property, townhouses and 2-3br condos. Some of the condos were near the pool and you can hear the pool noise. The staff was very kind and friendly, we particularly enjoyed the front desk staff and the water slide attendants. The pool was by far our favorite part. It was clean and well maintained. It was heated and there was one water slide. They are currently building a larger water park area with 3 slides we look forward to returning and using that in the future. I am told there may be a fee associated with it. Upon booking we were told there were no resort fees. Which is true however...if you intend on using any of the sports facilities there IS a fee-so technically that is a resort fee. The fee is $5 PER use...which can add up when you have kids that want to play basketball, then tennis, then volleyball. There is a equipment deposit also but that is returned when you bring it back. The sports fields and courts are about 1/2 mile walk from the clubhouse. All facilities were well maintained.  There were plenty of chairs but they do fill up fast. You can bring small coolers to the pool which we appreciated. Pool was spotless. The crowd was mixed with seasonal renters and families. There is a small arcade many older games and a small gym. There was also a movie theater where times can be reserved to watch a movie of your choice. There were a couple playground areas, the castle one we loved. The other was in a further away area and we didn’t make it there. The one and only area we felt needed improvement was the “sundry store.” They sell some small overpriced groceries, cold drinks, ice cream and food. The store was always swamped with people. There didn’t seem to be proper equipment to make the fried food fast enough. Many people were waiting awhile for some not so great fried food and pizza. We did not care for the food at all and would not call this a dining on property option. Ice cream was slightly better but toppings were limited and being served from cups with suran wrap over them. Maybe proper storage containers would be a better idea. Staff in the shop seemed grouchy and often not friendly.  The whole property is gated and very safe. We did have a few rowdy neighbors that were rentals but someone came and they quieted down real fast. We did see a large number of black cats roaming the property at night...many were thin and looked like strays. On a walk back from the pool on night we counted 12 in a 6 minute walk...just strange. Overall we look forward to returning to Windsor Hills Resort and checking out the water park area when it’s finished.

Desde afuera nos conectamos al wifi de la casa y ahí vimos que teníamos un mail de hacía unas pocas horas en el que nos decían que lamentablemente hubo u error por parte de ellos y que la casa no estaba disponible. La habíamos pagado hacía casi 3 meses. Nos dieron una provisoria en otro resort. Cuando protestamos el Sr. John nos destratò. Finalmente se encargó otra persona más razonable y nos dió otra casa en otro resort que no debía estar en uso porque estaba muy mal mantenida. En la sala de juego había mugre de muuucho tiempo y el inventario tenía más del doble de cosas que las que había en realidad. Nos ofrecieron como compensación calentar la piscina a su costo. Pero también estaba sin mantenimiento así que a los pocos días dejó de circular el agua. Por lo que no sólo no estaba caliente sino que no se podía usar.

(We didn't really need a place this big, but it was all we could get on short notice.) There was a small screened patio, and a kitchen that was sufficiently equipped for our needs. The overall size of the condo was fine. Physically, the place was comfortable. It was in mostly good condition, although it could use a few small repairs or updates.We could hear random noises from adjoining condos - fortunately, nothing too bad, but we were aware of movements upstairs (they got up a lot during the night) and we could hear plumbing sounds when people ran the shower, flushed toilets, or used the garbage disposal.The hallways in this building are very echoey, and unfortunately a lot of people think it's great to let their kids wander through there, shouting and shrieking. A lot of adults also shout to each other from one end of the hallway to another. The noise is greatly amplified. We were very happy not to be near the pool, as it was a magnet for loud screaming people and their kids.The worst was one day when we wanted to stay in and rest. It happened to be landscaping day at our building. From 8:00 am to late afternoon, incredibly loud machinery, often right by our window. I know landscaping has to be done, but must it go on and on for eight hours in one location?Except for the landscaping day, the noise problem wasn't enough to ruin our stay. The location is good. It's reasonably close to all the Disney parks. There is also shopping and dining not far away.

We attended during the Easter period so there was an Easter hunt held for the children. The cost of the resort shop was fairly priced offering a variety of your everyday essentials.

The location is great to the highways and parks. A new Walmart is coming nearby (might increase traffic a bit, but convenient). Lots of restaurants and shopping nearby if you have a car (which is a must for this location).The rentals are owned by different people, so conditions will vary. This is our 4 stay since 2014 and we used the same company 3 of the 4 times. So we kind of know what we are getting with the unit The other company had a reputable unit as well and the furnishings were also great. I will say it is hit or miss with what comes in the unit. These are rentals and not a hotel. There was one that had such crappy towels and wash clothes, we went out and bought our own. One unit had dishwasher detergent, extra toilet paper, paper towels, and washing detergent and others didn't. Just be on notice.The facilities are decent. Pool with slide, game room, pool table, table tennis, store with prepared concession type food, basketball, tennis courts. We spend most of time away at the parks and other attractions, so it fits us okay. We do a day at the pool, table tennis, and two games of pool (deposit required and time limit for pool and table tennis, sport stuff). The theater was down this last time, but we have never used it before. We have never had an issue with noise but we don't stay near the pool. We've only stayed in 2/3br condos. Parking can be hard for some units but you will find a space somewhere. The gatehouse can have a long line and they are pretty strict about getting everything set up with your access pass.

We booked our villa through thetopvillas.com and we stayed in number 450, which is number 2345 on Archfeld Blvd in Windsor Hills and it was brilliant. It was a lovely villa, i think it was one of the more recently built ones from the photos of other villas we looked at before booking ours and it was perfect. It's a six bedroom villa and we were a family of four, which worked out well for us as we did a lot of shopping in Orlando and ended up using one of the rooms for suitcases and shopping bags! It was an extremely well equipped villa, particularly in the kitchen, which contained everything we could possibly need and more - although we ate out most meals so we didn't use it much anyway. I've read other reviews of it being very loud and drunk people however we found it the complete opposite. On the first night the family opposite us were quite noisy but we only heard them whilst we were bringing in the luggage from the car but apart from that the other 10 nights of our stay it was really peaceful and calm. The villa we stayed in was very nice with nice furniture and very clean and modern with big flat screen tv's in every room and a nice large pool. The only couple of things that could have been better is that nearer to the end of our stay, a few ants started to appear in the master bathroom - I'm not sure where they suddenly came from but it wasn't ideal! The other issue is that there was only a tiny amount of toilet paper in the house, which was fine as we went out and purchased it along with drinks and things to fill the fridge but i would have expected for them to give us a little more in the first place. Overall, i highly recommend this complex if you're staying in Orlando with kids or just a group of adults wanting to do all of the parks.

It used to be such a great resort, in a great location with easy access to the parks. To say we are shocked at the decline of this resort is an understatement and if you are travelling with young children AVOID unless you are the type of family that are happy to throw your kids in bed and leave them to it while your outside getting drunk and partying the night away. Because this is now Windsor Hills party central where all you can hear is loud music and adults screaming and shouting to each until 3 or 4 in the morning. I'm sure some villas are in competition with each other to see who can be the loudest. It as been so bad some nights we have ended up with our grandchildren in bed with us because they have been woken up scared by the noise. The villa we stayed in was in need of upgrading but was well equipped with the basics we needed. Saying this if I was an owner here I don't think I would upgrade with the change in clientele. Has I would say Windsor Hills is now suited for more older families with teenagers or the group's of young adults we have seen. We did get a few good night's when we went to the coast for a few days which we loved. So if your young and love pool parties throughout the night. This is the place to be.

We have stayed in two other condos and they were excellent. Well equipped and very clean and furnished nicely. Had almost anything you would need including beach towels, plenty of bath towels and wash cloths, plenty of sheets, newer TV's in every room, etc. We absolutely loved it. This time we stayed in #101 on the first floor. The furnishings are older and missed matched. The coffee pot base hasn't been cleaned in a long while. The pots that are there are scratched to the point of absolutely needing replacement. Everything stuck to them and they were horrible. No washcloths. There were only 4 in our party, but if we had had 8 like we normally have in our group we felt there wouldn't have been enough towels unless you kept washing them each time to have enough. We bought a couple of new towels to use. Since we were on the first floor, you heard people walking around the condo late at night and whoever was above our condo was running constantly at night even at 11 PM and one night until 2 AM. The other condos we had stayed at were on the upper floors. The pool which we normally loved had many large groups of people who would congregate in the entrance way to the pool with liquor, coolers and were very loud. Then the kids were in the pool unsupervised and some of them were jumping the fence and using the slide after hours. We saw someone smoking in the pool area. An adult with a group of children in the pool with a drink (liquor) and cursing. The unsupervised children were being obnoxious and splashing and making it hard for those with smaller children to swim. The TV's in the two bedrooms (the third bedroom did not have one like the other condos did) were fuzzy and need to be replaced. If you don't put the dryer on the timed dry it keeps running and doesn't shut off. There is no mixer and any baking pans at all. So if you want to make pizza, brownies or anything else that you'd like to bake bring your own pans. We were checking the pillows and there was hair on one and stains on one of them so we ended up going and buying new sheets and new pillows to use during our stay. In our opinion everything is older, some things stained and needs updating or replacement. At 4 AM the TV in one of the bedrooms popped on. We've decided that when we come down again we will be looking for another complex which is a shame because we've always liked Windsor Hills and have recommended it to our friends. Suggestions: Put in ceiling fans, make a listing of TV channels and laminate it for ease to find channels, replace two TV's in bedrooms and purchase one for the third bedroom, buy several more bath towels and add normal sized beach towels, replace pans and add bakeware, buy a mixer. There was a bench seat and 4 chairs which would seating at the table for 6 people not for 8. There was a large seat on the patio and it would have been nice to have a small table with chairs so you could sit out to have coffee in the morning or eat a snack. Replace pillows. We could not get the screened door locked on lanai so we didn't want to leave our beach items out there to dry. I also bought my own dish towels, hot pads and dish rags and left them for future guests. That's all that I can remember. P.S. I just called the management company to try and voice my concerns and he really didn't care. So that is a shame that they wouldn't want to take comments to make vacationer's stays more enjoyable.",2017/07/31,2017/07/01,Traveled with family,1  ,,1,3,1,4,,3,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/winstonmom1,31,5,,,4,54,26,,20,8,16,5,5,0,0,59,"Saint Peters, Missouri",2009/10/01, 5631 ,25,2019/01/02

Also there were a selection of pushchairs/strollers that came in very handy during our stay.We stayed for 2 weeks, during that two weeks we had 3 issues that dampened our stay: 1) our upstairs air conditioning unit failed, it was 30c plus, walking from down stairs to upstairs was a bit like opening a hot oven! But this was fixed within hours and when the engineer came at around 1am he was really good about it and had it fully working within half an hour. Was a really good bloke too, after a short chat it was apparent he'd started work at 5am and still had work to do, but he was so chipper about it. 2) the freezer stopped freezing, after one repair that sadly failed they replaced the freezer and offered reimbursement for perished food. Whole thing took two days and Global were great in terms of time frames and so on.3) our pool turned green shortly before we left, this meant we couldn't use it for a handful of days before we left. Which was a shame as we were looking toward to a soak in the pool before we left. Again Global got someone out straight away and although it wasn't sorted to a usable standard before we left, it was fixed. But even though we had these issues, it didn't ruined our holiday and as I said above they got on it and got it fixed as quickly as possible. Can't fault them, things break sometimes sadly. On the upside the next guests should have a a fully working freezer, air con and pool. He he.I would recommend a villa to anyone who is planning on visiting Florida, this particular villa is minutes away from all the parks, half an hour tops to most of the main theme parks. The longest trip we had to make was 1hr 45mins to clear water. The airport is only 25-30mins away too. Yes the villa is a slightly more expensive option but for ease and access it's definitely the better choice. Will be going again, will be hoping to stay in the same villa. There is also a main communal pool on the complex, also a shop, gym and so on.

And I'd take ground floor cool and quiet comfort any day over 2nd, 3rd, or 4th floor heat and people stomping around. The apartment was actually completely quiet and the resort itself didn't even have many noise/troublemakers. The pool is definitely the best part with it's 84 constant degrees, beach-like slope for toddlers, and small water slide for the bigger kids. The pool even overlooks Reedy Lake, which is a small, idylic, man-made pond with lily pads and tons of water birds. There is a small clubhouse with a workout room with a half-dozen weight machines and a few treadmills/elipticals, as well as a small theater that they show movies at. And there are even two pool tables. Across the breezeway, there's also a small store for emergency essentials, and they also serve a couple of beers there on tap in plastic cups that you can take right out to the pool area (got a couple of Stellas for only about $6 for a 16 oz!) -- actually many people were drinking right at the pool as long as there weren't glass containers.We absolutely loved our apartment, and we'd definitely stay at Windsor Hills again...maybe next time we'll upgrade to a townhouse or even single-family rental which they also have here!",2017/05/03,2017/04/01,Traveled with family,2  ,,5,5,0,0,5,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmbcde,209,6,man,35-49,27,226,117,Foodie,76,109,23,12,6,0,0,262,"Derry, New Hampshire",2010/09/01, 23757 ,58,2019/01/02

If you are doing the WDW visits then you are only 5 minutes away from the 'Gates of Disney' and minutes away from all the restaurants on the 192.Upon arrival at the resort we have always been greeted professionally by the gate security staff who are always jovial….even if there’s a typhoon or hurricane going on around them (Hurricane Matthew!!) Every time you pass through the gates after this, they always give you a wave and a smile. We had a very minor issue with our gate access card not working, they were apologetic and got the problem rectified fairly quickly.The resort is laid out in a logical manner. When you first drive in, on your right is the junction for the club house and access to the Condos. If you carry straight on to the left are the ‘town houses.’ As you keep travelling forwards/ahead there is a conservation lake to the right which is fenced off with neat metal fencing. There are trees lining down the centre of the road up to this point. If you continue ahead there are a multitude of junctions which lead to the 4,5 and 6 bedroom houses.The 2 houses we have had have been 5 and 6 bedrooms. The most recent trip was a 6 bedroom house and it was fantastic, plenty of room for our family of 3 and the also 3 grand parents!! The houses are well kept as are the grounds which the grounds men/women work very hard to keep the grass cut and bushes trimmed. Dotted around the site are children’s play areas, one of which is a large castle style structure. We have only spent a short period of time there which my daughter did enjoy…..kids wouldn’t get bored.The clubhouse is kept smart and the pool is a decent size with a fairly big waterslide for a resort like this. We only went to the clubhouse once as we did have our own pool and were doing the WDW and Universal attractions all day so really didn’t get much time in to do the clubhouse!!Overall……Windsor Hills Resort is a fantastic security gated site in a great position and I believe the closest one to WDW. If you like peace and tranquility after a day at the parks then this is the place to stay. All the staff are welcoming and polite in my experience….we hope to be back soon!!",2017/03/31,2016/10/01,Traveled with family,,5,5,,0,0,,5,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichieG1772,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,0,0,4,"County Durham, United Kingdom",2016/04/01, 160 ,3,2019/01/02

I can highly recommend this set-up. We were in a quiet, well-cared for, landscaped, safe, secure community with every amenity imaginable! All guests renting homes within the community can use the gym facilities &amp; game rooms. There is a convenient store on site to pick up necessities, although we had a rented car and there are a huge number of stores &amp; restaurants close by in the surrounding area like McDonald’s, Publix Supermarkets (huge selection &amp; great prices &amp; deals), Super Target, Chick Filet, Black Angus Steaks, Ponderosa,Taco Bell, etc ! The home we rented was perfect for my 2 yr. old granddaughter. The kids’ bedrooms had many stuffed Disney characters &amp; we had many Disney DVD’s, books &amp; puzzles; as well as adult board games, pool table &amp; fooseball table for entertainment. Our kitchen was 1st rate (granite &amp; modern) with anything we needed to cook –new dishes, pans, cloth napkins, cutlery etc. We mostly ate out but usually ate breakfast at the house as well as some lunches. We did laundry with our washer &amp; dryer and had a screened in pool &amp; adjoining hot tub plus large gas grill. There is a large pool that all guests may use that is excellent and large play areas for kids.We were sharing the house with my daughter’s family so this made it about as expensive as renting individual hotel rooms once we’d split the cost. However, we had so much more for the money – the house had 2 spacious master bedrooms with adjoining baths and the 2 extra bedrooms each had their own bath as well. So technically, you could share the house with 4 couples without kids; or 2 or 3 families with a few kids. Lots of options!

We were not disappointed during this stay by our accommodation or the resort itself. The proximity to the Disney Parks makes the travel no longer than 10-15 minutes by car. These condos are privately owned and managed by some of the vacation rental groups in the area. Our condo was well appointed, comfortable and well stocked with every sort of utensil and having your own laundry facility makes life easy. The ability to have a meal at home in particular, breakfast or dinner allows you to relax prior to or after taking on the parks. Access to a grocery store is not easy so you will need a car, with a Publix (equivalent of Woolworths) store located around 5 minutes away. The resort pool is well supervised and not too deep so it is suitable for all ages, in particular young children. Security at the main gate ensures positive control of the facility. Overall this facility is well maintained and comfortable. If you are staying in the Kissimmee area you will need a car, because access to the myriad of parks, shopping centres and tourist destinations is not well supported by public buses.

The only good thing about this resort is its location which is very close to the main Disney parks about a 10 minute drive, also there's some good souvenir shop and a smallish super market close by about a minutes drive away.Now for the bad it may have just been bad luck but our particular villa seemed to have a cockroach infestation. On our first full day we were sitting in the lounge area relaxing and something ran past on the floor, I immediately put my feet on the sofa, within a 1 minute period something else ran across the floor, my partner went to investigate and to our disgust cockroaches. We contacted Virgin who had someone come and fumigate the house. The day after the fumigation we woke up to dead roaches about 5 just in the living room area alone not to mention the hallway. We were advised that after fumigation we would likely see dead roaches so it wasn't too much of a shock albeit disgusting and seriously made me itch. The day after seeing the dead roaches I went to the toilet in the middle of the night and screamed as again an alive roach running by, it was too late to call anyone being the middle of the night so I waited until the morning and made the mistake of going into the open wardrobe and yet another cockroach alive and well, to cut a long story short we demanded to be moved but unfortunately we were not moved far enough same resort but different villa, first few days were good but our last two days again yes you guessed it cockroaches alive and well darting across the floor and kitchen area.In a nutshell I would definitely not go back to this resort, we were so scared we would bring one of those disgusting things home with us in our luggage, also very unhygienic for my 12 month old who was still crawling at this stage,plus the first villa did not have commentary wifi the second villa that we moved to did though. Lastly I noticed that Virgin Holidays have stopped advertising this villa on their website I wonder if they no longer want to be associated with the place due to huge amount of complaints relating to cockroaches.",2016/09/22,2015/10/01,Traveled with family,3  ,,,,0,0,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dazz1e,9,4,,,,24,18,,2,9,7,6,1,0,0,25,"Greater London, United Kingdom",2016/03/01, 2518 ,20,2019/01/02

We went with extended family so there were 11 of us. The villa had ample room for all 11 of us 4 double bedroom and 2 twins with 2 of the rooms having their own en suites. The villa comprised of a walk through living-diner-kitchen area, 4 bathrooms, 6 bedrooms and a garage/ games room. The outdoor area had 6 sun longer a decent sized pool with a jacuzzi and there was room to park 2 cars of the front drive. The pool was fenced in by a big netted canvas which prevented bugs getting in but had a gate so the maintenance people could come and go as they pleased and clean the pool.The villa had wifi which was fast and connected well through the house and is located on a quiet road a short ride away from the disney parks.There were no issues with where the villa was situated the neighbourhood was quiet and the gate was 24/7. The first issue arose when we emailed the villa owner to ask how to turn the jacuzzi on. He informed there was an electric point outside near the pool which needed turning on. when we found the box it was hanging off the wall and seemed quite hazardous. We again emailed the owner to inform him of this issue. He said it would be sorted the next day. It was not. In fact it was not sorted until 4 days later.The second issue was that the aircn did not work in 2 of the bedrooms. Normally I wouldn't make a deal out of this but when it's 39 degrees Celsius with the sun shining directly in it becomes unbearable. The owner did not respond to this issue.On the 4th or 5th day of our visit there was a storm where lightening struck our local energy feed and caused a power outage for many homes on the complex. This was obviously unavoidable and no ones fault but when we contacted the gate house we were told to contact the villa owner as he would have to inform the energy supplier. We were told this would be fixed no later than 1:30. By 8:30pm we still had no electric. We contacted the villa owner but had no success. The power eventually came back on sometime later but we heard nothing from the home owner.As a result of this power out a component in our aircom unit had blown causing the temp inside the house to rise to 30 degrees C during the night and no one could sleep. The following morning we contacted the villa owner again who told us we could not contact him before 9am unless it ws an emergency, we explained that although he may not view it as an emergency it was something that needed fixing urgently, he told us to contact his office. The lady at the office was very helpful had someone out in a few hours of us contacting them.However, once the aircon was fixed it still did not work in 2 of the bedrooms. We informed the home owner of this via email but had no response. The information book which was provided by the home owners was also very out of date. A member of our party was taken very ill one night and the information provided in the book for ER and other various medical centres was all out of date. When trying to make a local call which is free from the landline was almost impossible as the phone line was so poor. So many complications in that situation could have been avoided if the phone worked properly and we were provided with basic and correct information.Two members of our party also resorted to sleeping on the sofas most nights as the beds in one of the rooms was so uncomfortable and dipped in the middle.We also had issues with all but one of the TVs in the house and could not get them working.Many of these things may seem like trivial issues but when you've paid a lot of money for a top rated luxurious villa you do not expect to be contacting the owner every other day. It meant we could not even live comfortably for our 2 weeks away in Florida and put a slight dampner on things. The complex itself was lovely and in close proximity to Disney and not too far from Universal, but we can say we will definitely not be stopping in this villa again. It is not worth the money or the hassle. I cannot speak for all villas on this complex but the villa on the corner of Archfield Boulevard 2615 is not one I would recommend.",2016/09/02,2016/08/01,Traveled with family,5  ,4,2,,0,0,,,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/94Heidi,19,5,woman,18-24,77,66,47,,39,14,6,4,3,0,0,144,"The Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield, United Kingdom",2013/08/01, 9082 ,32,2019/01/02

Wonderful! ,mjohy,We booked a 5 bedroomed Villa even though we only needed 2 rooms. In the past when we have booked 2-3 bed villas they haven't been so good. This villa was luxurious and we overlooked onto the lake which was wonderful. The villa was very large and spacious with all the amenities you would expect from this villa type. The screened pool was a big hit as you didn't have to dodge the insects although we had a gecko with us for our stay outside in the pool area!! Check-in was quick and the security guys on the gate were friendly and we felt safe. We had to keep a card in view in our car when parked in the resort and coming in we just scanned our card at the gate although for our last week the entrance area was being re-roofed and the guys would scan you in using your card. We didn't use the resort pool as it sounded noisy and we had our own lovely pool so didn't bother. The wi-fi was good at the villa but forget TV it was not good! Limited channels. Kitchen was great with American fridge and ice dispenser was a big hit! Washing machine and tumble dryer was great. Bedrooms were all large and nice bed linen. We shopped at Super Target on Rolling Oaks Blvd which was about 5 mins drive away. My only gripe with the villa ... there wasn't much privacy when outside. Each villa was side by side and very close. Villas we have stayed in in the past has shrubs so there was some privacy. You could hear neighbours conversations and it became annoying!! On the whole a lovely holiday and a great base for the parks. ,2016/08/25,2016/08/01,Traveled with family,,,,,0,0,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjohy,21,4,,,8,45,45,,29,8,4,1,3,0,0,54,,2015/03/01, 4815 ,27,2019/01/02

It started out with 15 people and by August the faithful 8 were on a road trip to Florida. With 6 drivers and 2 vans, a 5th old girl, 8 yr old nephew , his brother whom turned 18 2 days before, my 21 yr old daughter, my mom whom is a fabulous 71, my niece 33(those are her 2 sons) my brother and his wife,their 26 yr old son and his wife(5 month Maya is theirs) we zipped down the highway with maybe 5 stops on our 15 and half hr drive from Dallas TX. We arrived around 6ish Monday evening, where we checked out Id's at the gate, retrieved our car window sticker and door pad entry into home. I was the 2nd person to enter the home and scoped out a big bed straight ahead, so I ran to it and claimed that room for me and my daughter. My sister in law whom was the 1st to enter had to admit I was quicker(bad knee and all). The only one who tried to persuade me to give up this large bathroom attached room was my niece with the baby(she asked 3 times) I just looked at her(it is what it is). After My 2 nephews settle on the Disney room(twin beds), their mother grabbed the other Disney room(1 bed), my brother and his wife took the last big room upstairs. My mom took the room next to the entrance with the daybed, and the parents plus baby took the room to the left with bathroom attached. there was a half bath downstairs and the people on top shared the one bathroom. After the 1st day, the shower with the couple was stopped up(I know this though I never looked because they started using ours),The water was nice and hot. I never used the pool and small sauna(for maybe 2 people), but my nephews did outside on the patio. The couple at outside twice by the pool. We enjoyed eating together at the big table for 8, and playing cards/dominoes/checkers(we brought ourselves).There were a thousand people at Walmart on a Monday(it was a jungle, zoo, or concert inside literally) LOL. The game room which was in the garage was very hot to me(my nephews brother and daughter went in there every chance they got)they had a ceiling fan but still not enough for me to be in there over 30 min. We tried letting up the garage but there was no way to do this. We went to the community pool which was larger with a slide and played catch football. I went down the slide and it was fast for some and slow for others. plenty of room in the pool, they had a store to purchase snacks, food, wine, beer, pool items etc. The community was well kept up, clean, the trash is taken up every day before 8am(it says 7am). My bed was comfortable(I always bring my own sheets everywhere so that made it even more better). My 33 yr old niece said they could have washed the sheets and made them smell better(though she never took them off to wash them herself). We washed practically all the towels we used daily( I know housekeeping appreciated that) and my brother had the nerve to vacuum the upstairs before we left. We had fun and enjoyed our stay, I really cant say if I would go there again(maybe another one). We went to workout twice (me my daughter my brother his son) they had 2 treadmills, 2 elipticals, a few weight machines.i brought my dog(shitzo mixed with poodle) and he acted like he was at home, probably because everyone from home was there. We put him in his kennel with his toy when we went out. We were close to everything to do and eat. Overall it was comfortable than a hotel.",2016/08/22,2016/08/01,,,,,,0,0,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carla482015,83,6,woman,50-64,,147,29,,65,69,15,3,0,0,0,152,"Forney, Texas",2014/08/01, 15694 ,35,2019/01/02

Ideally located for Disney World and supermarkets/restaurants. Nice size pool and clubhouse. The biggest letdown was the luxury villa we rented, from the start we were given the wrong keycode from Global Management to finding out the most basic of items were missing, not a day went by without some problem rearing its head, fortunately our holiday company in the UK got their representative in Orlando to step in and help resolve some of them. This villa was booked on seeing the photos on Global's website, one of the sofas was missing and therefore not leaving enough seating for our party, there was no Fooseball as shown, and you could not use the Pool Table as there is not enough room to take shots. Two other points this is supposed to be a 5 bedroomed 10 people luxury villa there was not enough seating round the pool, and apart from the main bedroom all the other beds were uncomfortable and need to be replaced. We are taking this matter further with our holiday company, but l would advise anyone not to book villa 7769 Tosteth Street on the resort until it has been brought back up to the Luxury standard it is supposed to be.",2016/08/17,2016/08/01,Traveled with family,5  ,,,,0,0,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ceejayt_12,37,4,woman,65+,,47,34,,28,14,5,0,0,0,0,47,"Southampton, United Kingdom",2012/10/01, 4774 ,28,2019/01/02

This is a great location for running back and forth to any of the Disney parks. We often took a mid day break and ran back to our townhouse. We stayed in a 3 bedroom, 3 bathroom townhouse. Fun at Windsor Hills 2 to be specific. We were close to the main pool but still had to drive over with the kids. The pool was nice but the pictures online are deceiving. It looks much bigger in photos. It is a decent size but it was very crowded. Especially in the evening. They have a small water slide but our kids did not care for it. Follow up and communication from Windsor Hills was awful. The owner of our property was very attentive as I had to go to her for everything since employees would not respond. The townhouse was a perfect size but it is in need of routine maintenance. I had to personally fix some things while on vacation. Not what I wanted to do but I did it. We never got any follow up after our stay. No thank you, no how was your stay etc. our townhouse had a plunge pool. Our kids used it once because it was not very clean. Never saw anyone come by to clean things. When we arrived we had to check in with security at the gate. They were very slow and honestly not sure how much security they would be able to provide. They gave us a pass to use while getting in and out of the resort. You had to leave the pass on your dashboard in view. I find this funny as the personal gate codes for getting in the pool area and other places was clearly published for anyone to see. I thought maybe everyone had the same code so I checked someone else's vehicle and they had different codes. Not much security I would say!!Overall we enjoyed our stay and would probably stay at a different property within the resort. On a side note, there are a ton of different properties to stay at within this area. The location is great.

We stayed at Disney's Wilderness Lodge in 2014, and paid way less for this vacation than we did for the Disney Vacation in 2014. The house especially suited us because our young son became ill during the second half of the trip. My husband and I agreed that caring for him when he was so sick was way easier in a house than it would have been in a hotel room.Our house came with 4 bedrooms, six beds, 4 bathrooms and the screened in in-ground pool. It also came with a game room with pool, an arcade style game, air hockey and 2 video game systems. Everything was wonderful. There was also a main clubhouse with a pool with a big waterslide. We had a fantastic owner we worked with too.

Ideal para quem tem filhos ou quer levar os pais mais velhos, pois a rotina pode ser seguida como em casa mas adicionada com quartos temáticos, cozinha completa e uma variedade enorme de lazer. Eu enchi os armários e geladeira com sucos orgânicos, verduras lavadas três vezes prontas para consumir, pães deliciosos, salmão do Alaska , frutas e legumes ( tudo comprado no Walmart ou Publix a bons preços) para que todos tivessem comida em casa à vontade. Vamos lá: tem uma piscina principal com tobogã muito boa, que é aquecida nos meses de inverno e funciona até as 22 hs no verão. Ela é usada pelas pessoas que ficam nos prédios, pois as casas do condomínio tem piscina própria. Há música ambiente e jacuzzis aquecidas, porém só permitidas para uso adulto. Tem guardas na piscina que ficam de olho nas crianças e professora de hidro às quintas. Há também um mini mercado com as conveniências básicas e uma batata frita na hora que é um vício... A concierge é bem útil, chama taxi, presta informações gerais. Parquinhos de areia, castelinhos, balanços, quadras de vôlei, basquete e tênis e uma paisagem gostosa para caminhar ou andar de bike. Enfim, para colaborar com mais informações sobre custo benefício: apartamento de 3 quartos e 2 banheiros: média de 175 dólares dia em julho e 130 em janeiro. A limpeza do corredor e das escadas deixou a desejar, mas isso, para nós, foi só um detalhe.

I have booked with golfpac before. The golfpac web site only a shows the likeness of a typical 4 bedroom house. We arrived on Saturday May 14, 2016. Walked in the house on comrow street and it was so dated I felt like it was 1985. 20 inch tube television in the living room and the same in the master. The other two bedrooms had no TV. The house was beat up, outdated and was sparsely stocked. Opened up the curtains to look at the pool and it was green! Called Global and they said they would send over the pool company. Early Sunday morning they were cleaning the pool. We went golfing came back around 2:00p and the pool was still green. The house certainly wasn't rental ready! Called Global and wanted a new house between the pool and the beat up dated house we had enough. They gave us a beautiful home for the rest of the week.This is what you need to watch out for. Make sure you see pictures of the exact house that you'll be staying in. I'm not sure who to point the finger at but I would say both golfpac and global. First golfpac should know what kind of home and what condition it is in. They should have have a standard that they should follow. As for Global they need to inspect their properties before they rent them for the week. Also stayed at other resorts like this and some have standards regarding what type of furniture, appliances and electronics in the house. Some owners could care less (like the home on comrow street). For dining purposes Eddy V's was awesome! The service outstanding from start to finish. The fresh seafood tower was worth $75.00. Shrimp &amp; lobster cocktail, oysters and lump crab meat. Shrimp &amp; lobster bisque served in in its own pot poured into a blazing hot ceramic bowl. Ahi tuna and sea bass was exceptional. The desserts were truly phenomenal. The bananas fosters was grand as well as the others. Reasonable priced $$$$ for what you get.Ruth Chris on a Sunday was dead.

Because we were so close to the main pool we didn’t use the pool at the house much at all. There is small shop by the main pool which is reasonably priced and has snacks and snack bar food and alcoholic drinks too. I was surprised that there were no beach/pool towels in the house to use, so we had to use the white bath towels.

The kitchen is well equipped however. The property itself is very well maintained. The security at this gated community is something else. The guards are all nice and polite but there is this older guard-who really takes his job seriously. Our pass was hard to scan for the first cupla days for some reason, until another guard took it back and fixed it somehow. We held up one of the lines to exit, and this guard came running out, red-faced, screaming to the cars behind to move to the other lane and to keep the lines moving. It became a joke with our girls before we got the pass fixed. Every time we got to the gate, they were on their best behaviour and they kept saying ""daddy, hurry it up before that guard comes out and screams at us"". I want to take him home. LOL.

Pool surround was very clean with clean pool. A couple brick pavers around pool deck had sunk a fraction, but these homes are 10years old ! and did'nt cause us any problems at all. House had plenty of towels for use.This was my second time at Windsor Hills resort. It's conveniently located for the main attractions and all the main restaurants nearby on 192. It took 13mins from Disney parking lot to being parked back at house, although traffic was kind that night.Would recommend this resort of Windsor Hills and this Storytime #4 townhouse to anyone looking for a quite stay in a great resort with great facilities.Tip: do not check in between 4 and 5 on a saturday. Maybe a bit later as lots of traffic queing out of gate for entrance pass, although it was'nt too bad.I will return again one day.",2016/04/11,2016/03/01,Traveled with family,,,,,1,2,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Martyn77,128,6,man,,19,105,58,Family Vacationer,18,58,27,0,2,0,0,124,"Exeter, United Kingdom",2010/07/01, 11133 ,39,2019/01/02

If you are staying off property and you plan to drive in and out/park at Disney yourself this is a great option. Universal and Seaworld are about 20 minutes away. Windsor Hills is gated, safe, the grounds are kept well and the public pool/playgrounds are well maintained. I've stayed at 4, 5 &amp; 6 bedroom houses, as well as 3 bedroom condo's at Windsor Hills Resort. Each unit is individually owned so the decor and updating varies from unit to unit. Make sure you browse all photo's of each unit to make sure it accommodates your needs. There are grocery stores and restaurants all within a mile of the neighborhood and it is about 30 minutes from the airport. When you check in, there is sometimes a line which could take 20 minutes or so before you get into your rental home. This is because the security team is very thorough which we appreciated to ensure safety of vacationers.The pool is quite large and heated with waterslide, snack bar and gym all at the nice clubhouse. For condos, the large pool is your only option. Most of the houses have a private pool/jacuzzi in the backyard. Tip: to use the heaters for the pools, you have to pay extra. Make sure the heater is turned on before you get there from whomever you rent from. The pool can take up to a full day to get warm depending on time of year. Windsor hills is also centrally located to get to many golf courses. Mystic Dunes, Reunion, Disney, Grand Cypress, Tranquillo, Celebration, OCN, Orange Lake, all within 20 minutes or less.If you are looking for a relaxing, Orlando vacation with close proximity to the parks without staying on premise, then Windsor Hills is a very nice option for families.",2016/03/28,2016/03/01,Traveled with family,,4,,4,0,0,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L510BRjamieh,6,2,,,9,5,30,,1,4,0,0,0,0,0,14,,2015/07/01, 800 ,20,2019/01/02

We stayed at a 5 bedroom villa rented from a private individual. FANTASTIC stay. The resort is VERY conveniently located, roughly 15 mins from all major Disney attractions, 10 minutes from Target (which has Groceries), and 10 minutes from TJ MAX and ROSS (which is VERY important for us Canadians looking to do some value shopping!!). The resort offers luxury villas, such as ours, townhomes and condos. The villas maximize the comforts of home (fully equipped kitchen, laundry, 4 bathrooms and TVs in each room) which makes travel with kids and extended family quite doable! The resort has a wonderful large pool with a slide the kids enjoyed, as well as the usual arcades/ping pong/billiards and ice cream set up. The noise level at night was fine, especially in a villa, but if looking to maximize silence, aim for a villa off the main street, ideally with one neighbour and backing out onto the greenspace.The one issue I encountered: Check into the ""gated"" part. The first time you enter the resort, you must register your vehicle and you get all the pass codes for the main gate, the gym, the playground, etc. We were checking in on saturday night of the beginning of March break, and therefore, there was an HOUR wait at the gates. I'm not sure if this was due to March break, or if this is every saturday night. Needless to say, my kids did not fare well with this after all the travel (neither did I to be honest). We got out of the care and proceeded to our home on foot (luckily took about 15 mins) while my husband waited. However, please calculate this into your travel as a possibility.I DO believe that the resort could easily rectify this by having more staff available for check in during busy times. They did not seem overly concerned by the 30+ car line up in front of their gates!Other than that, lovely stay!!!

Leading up to our vacation, I researched countless properties in the Orlando area to stay at. I decided on the Windsor Hills Resort because it had excellent online reviews on Trip Advisor &amp; other websites, its location was very close to the Walt Disney World area (less than 5 minutes away), the amenities the resort offered were great- gated community with security, large complex swimming pool &amp; hot tub, movie &amp; games room at resort clubhouse, convenience store, very large park &amp; playground area for the kids, and the pictures posted on their website looked very nice. Once I decided this was where I wanted to stay, I researched the available properties there. From what I could tell, the available units in the resort are rented on an individual basis, and can vary greatly. Some are managed by the resort, others by 3rd party rental agencies, or run individually. In the end, I decided on “Bashful’s Bungalow"", you can look it up online, a 3 x bedroom townhouse unit. Based on the information on their website, this is one of 2 x properties available by the owner at the resort complex (the other is called `Happy`s Hangout, which I believe is the townhouse unit right next door`). The reason I decided to stay there were many. First- their website for this property listing was very professional. This is important, as to me it is an indicator of not only how they run their business, but also how serious they are about renting and maintaining their property. The pictures posted online were excellent quality- not all fuzzy and blurry. It shows they really took the time to advertise this unit accurately. Second- the listing stated that the unit was completely renovated last year, and all furniture &amp; appliances in the unit were brand new. I figured having everything top to bottom brand new had to be good. Third- this unit had its own screened-in pool, which I thought was a wonderful bonus feature. As stated- there is already a pool at the resort, but having your own private pool is great. Fourth- the layout of the unit was what I was looking for. It had one bedroom off the main entrance with its own full bathroom, 2 x other bedrooms upstairs, each with its own full bathroom. For me, this worked out well, as we were travelling with the grandparents, and they were able to stay on the main level, not having to worry about climbing up and down the stairs, and also had a bit of a break away from the kids in the evening. Booking the unit was very easy and straightforward. It was all done online via email, payment via credit card. Standard rental agreement forms, security deposit, no issues with any of this. Extra charges for the unit included the pool heater, and renting a BBQ for the week (based on my research these appear to be standard extra charges for most rentals in the area). Now- since it was February when we stayed there, I would highly recommend if you are visiting during the winter months to get the pool heated, definitely worth it in my opinion. Note- you can`t adjust the pool temperature yourself, so if you want this be sure to request it ahead of time. Confirmation of rental, directions to the property were fine- no concerns finding the place. Upon arrival, we found the place very clean. All the furniture as stated was brand new and in great shape. The pictures are definitely accurate- it is really beautiful inside. The flat screen TV in the living area is massive- perfect for the kids watching Disney movies. There are also TVs in every bedroom too (all brand new flat screens), all of them have cable. Wi-Fi is available at the unit. All the appliances worked, no concerns with the kitchen area. There was plenty of space, it didn’t feel cramped or crowded. The main bedroom upstairs is very large, plenty of room. In the kids room upstairs- the “lighted beds” were a huge hit. My daughter loved them, plus they were a lot of fun for the adults too. Gaining entrance to the resort and the property were problem free throughout our visit. The keyless entry was handy- I didn’t have to worry about losing the keys or locking myself out. The unit is conveniently located just across the street from the resort pool and clubhouse- very short walk- like 30 x seconds. No issues at all with noise or traffic during our stay. There was a stroller located in the unit- this came in handy for taking to the theme parks. Pool temperature on arrival was great, and the BBQ was there as requested. There is also a washer &amp; dryer there as well- normally I don’t like to do laundry on vacation but I did find this useful. The resort is very close to a wide variety of restaurants, gift shops, and other Orlando attractions as well. There is a grocery store, Target store maybe 5-10 minute drive down the road, so you can find virtually anything you may need. The resort advertised that it did have a shuttle service to/from the Disney Parks, but I had a car so I never used it- I can’t tell you whether it is good or bad. Most of the people staying in the resort looked to be families with small kids on vacation, and the occasional retirees. Overall I thought the place was fantastic. If you were thinking about visiting Disney World, but did not want to stay at the Disney Resorts, this place is perfect. It is obvious that this rental unit is professionally run, and well maintained. I am sure that I will be visiting Orlando- and Disney World, again in the future, and I would definitely stay here again. We had a great time, and I would highly recommend this spot to anyone.",2016/02/19,2016/02/01,Traveled with family,3  ,,5,,0,0,5,5,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ryan613,5,1,,,,4,18,,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,"Ottawa, Canada",2013/05/01, 418 ,12,2019/01/02

The location was minutes from all of them. Everything else you may need during your stay was only minutes away as well. We had 4 adults and 2 small children in a 3 bedroom, two bath condo for a 4 night stay. There was plenty of space for all of us. The property was very safe and secure, in a gated community. My sister felt safe enough to stay there alone while we had a late night at the Magic Kingdom. The condo was super clean, well stocked with dishes and such. I do recommend bringing your own trash bags, paper towels and coffee filters. We even grabbed some laundry detergent at the Super Target up the road and took advantage of the washer and dryer so we did not have to come home with dirty laundry! The unit we had was managed by Global Resort Homes. We arrived at 9:30 that night, the office was closed but the after hours process was simple as all we had to do was pick up our packet from a coded box. If you do have to do a late check in, the only down side is having to physically check in at their office before noon the next day. This was a little inconvenient for us because they did not open until 9 and we wanted to be at the Magic Kingdom at 8. This will definitely be our go to location for future trips!

There is a washer/dryer in the upstairs, which was great. Also, there was a very nice playpen/crib, two strollers, and a booster seat. There were plenty of dishes and towels. It was a nice quiet area.You are very close to Disney, and can see/hear the Wishes fireworks show. There is space for one car at the condo, and I would imagine other parking would be available. The wifi worked great- even with two teens using it! The owners were very prompt the few times we needed to contact them (we forgot the key code ). They were pleasant and easy to deal with.The only down side we had were the security guards at the gate - on two separate occasions, they were very rude.

There are many levels and varieties of properties within, I would like to comment on our recent rental. The property is pretty much as described by the Rental Manager (All Star Vacation Homes), but unfortunately the property could be greatly improved with a detailed ""tune up"". Several important issues have been overlooked (ignored) by the Manager (eg: out of date worn out mattresses, completely inadequate internet service, peeling plastic laminate kitchen counters and cupboards, somewhat inadequate ""fully equipped kitchen"" items (what fully equipped kitchen does not have a coffee maker - tea pot - table knives (six were available), burned out light bulbs throughout etc. etc.), a BBQ being disgustingly filthy without any ability to light it, broken garbage container, absolutely filthy entrance slab and windows, and the list goes on. The refrigerator was superficially clean, however had an overwhelming rotten fish odor apparently left over from previous renters. The under sink garburator leaked significantly. On a positive note, the games room, and the three small bedrooms are very pleasantly decorated and comfortable, the private swimming pool / hot tub combo was great and overall the property is decent accommodation for a reasonable price in a good location, however, far from luxurious as represented by the Manager. Accommodation for 10 is comfortable, 12 a stretch. A great improvement to render the outside patio area more pleasant would be a sound wall to hopefully mute the unbearable noise from the neighboring A/C unit.Conclusion, a reasonably priced convenient property for a large group (we were 9) but in need of significant updating and fine tuning.",2016/01/06,2015/12/01,Traveled with family,5  ,,4,,0,0,3,,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robert154933,5,2,,,,6,8,,1,1,2,1,1,0,0,6,"Kelowna, Canada",2006/08/01, 763 ,10,2019/01/02

The 3 bedroom, 2 full bath condo was clean and came with nice furniture, beds, washer and dryer, nice stocked kitchen full of nice dishes and pots and pans, etc. This may seem as things one would expect but we have plenty of stories about how one shouldn't make assumptions! The condo has 10 foot ceilings, nice eating area, plenty of hot water with good pressure, effective air conditioning, and a nice walk out lanai which also served as a second entrance door as we rented a ground floor unit. The welcome center is small but offers a small theatre, exercise room, game room, and sundry shop. The swimming pool is absolutely great for young children, as it is not deeper than 3 1/2 feet and has a great curvy water slide. The only down side was that everything required a passcode to enter, even restrooms, but too much security these days is better than not enough.",2015/12/25,2015/12/01,,,,,,0,0,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/636jeff,58,6,man,50-64,83,132,61,History Buff,62,31,24,15,1,0,0,218,"Fredericktown, Ohio",2004/03/01, 15911 ,54,2019/01/02

Actually built in 2006 The location is perfect for Disney and the villa would have been great if it was clean and the Management Company dealt with issues! The villa is a little tired and needing some money spent on it eg .. kitchen utensils, outdoor furniture. We had problem from the start with lack of communication from Management Company, they do not answer their phone so end up leaving messages which they do not deal with. Shower door was missing in one of the en-suites, it had been broken by previous occupant however it was replaced within a few days. our major issue was with jacuzzi, pool heat, filthy pool area and COCKROACH infestation. We had communication with owner who tried to sort things out with Management Company but they did not do what they were asked. The villa/pool area were 'deep cleaned' in September but when Sandy Wang the owner saw our photos agreed that this HAD NOT been done! We had a problem with no pool heat which we paid for and a jacuzzi that didn't bubble (filterss were blocked) but kept being palmed off being told that the pool was at the correct temperature. Turns out that the power had tripped and there was no power going to heater. Only then was it sorted, a few days before the end of our holiday! The pool area/furniture was covered in spider webs, complete with big spiders and cockroaches! Someone turned up with a brush to sort that problem!! Said they would come back the following day to power hose.That didn't happen because when we returned after a day out we still had our resident spiders/cockroaches. We complained on numerous occasions about the cockroaches inside the house, not just in one area - upstairs, downstairs bathroom, on the cooker!! We were told pest control had been and couldn't see anything!! There was no evidence of the house being sprayed. Pest control and the Management Co decided they were coming under the garage door and told the owner they had built a small wall to prevent this happening until the door could be sorted LIES!! Generally the villa needs a little TLC, replace bulbs in lights/lamps, batteries in remotes etc,etc.... We had part of our pool heating payment returned but I contacted the owner requesting a further refund as we were unable to use the pool/pool area and found the cockroach infestation unacceptable. We have stayed in many other villas in the area and never experienced this. We were told by the owner that 'normal' people would have checked out straight away and she would have refunded us 100% - I doubt this very much!!! Even if we had where were we to drum up another $4000 to rent a 'luxury' villa??? This was a special holiday to celebrate various special birthdays within the family and it was spoilt due to the condition of this property! When I told the owner I would be taking matters further I was told not to threaten her!! Unbelievable, I do not threaten people!! Perhaps the villa lies empty and the Management Company do not keep on top of things?? The owner admitted that they promise the world and do not carry things out. That is for Sandy Wang to address to ensure that guests do not have to put up with these conditions! My advice would be to avoid this property and if you have already booked I would consider cutting your loses and cancel even if it means loosing your deposit!",2015/12/10,2015/10/01,Traveled with family,9  ,,,,1,4,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DisneyWorld2015,14,5,,,17,55,37,,16,24,10,4,1,0,0,72,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",2013/02/01, 6052 ,29,2019/01/02

Because of that, our options limited as to availability. So, bear that in mind as you read my review.Each condo, townhouse, and home is privately owned, so you are renting from an owner or a management company for the owner. That is noteworthy for a couple of reasons. 1. The toiletries and supplies may vary considerably, and:2. You cannot change units if you have any issues.3. Each owner lists his/her own unit but may leave out some details compared to a company listing.We stayed in a 2 bedroom condo on the second floor.The one we stayed in had only 1 roll of toilet paper per bathroom. A tiny bar of soap (enough for hand washing for the week) was supplied. There was no shampoo. I didn't realize there was no shampoo or soap until my first Target run, so I had to run back immediately.The unit I rented was clean and nicely decorated. I have no complaints there. I also didn't find any bugs. It was not updated as the kitchen didn't have granite and the bathrooms didn't have granite or tile, but they were clean and functional and those things aren't as important to me, but I am mentioning them because some people may feel they are important.My only complaint was the noise level. I don't know what in the world the people above us were doing but they sounded like a heard of elephants going back and forth and banging around. They didn't settle down until around midnight each night, sometimes a bit after midnight. The people next door, however, thought 6am was a great time to get up. UGH. So, sleep was a bit of an issue.If you rent at WH, I suggest you either find a top floor condo or rent townhouse or house. If we go to WH again, we will not be getting a condo with people above us.",2015/10/15,2015/10/01,Traveled with family,1  ,5,3,,0,0,4,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dawn415,97,2,,,,6,10,,1,2,0,1,2,0,0,6,"Charlotte, North Carolina",2008/03/01, 620 ,13,2019/01/02

That evening around 8 pm, a brazen cockroach came crawling out around the toaster area. We still found a cockroach crawling around after the exterminator came. One morning we found a huge palmetto dead on its back lying on the bathroom floor. We were uncomfortable all week long. We were so careful not to leave any doors open and also did not leave any food around. I had to wash every dish and glass every time we used them because we were so repulsed at the thought of the bugs crawling on the utensils and dinnerware.

The house was huge and very impressive, like something out of Dynasty or The Colbys. Kitchen/living area well set out and cosy but spacious, dining table just about fit us all around it so not sure it would be good enough for more than 8 people (even though it was a 6 bedroom condo), pool cost a lot to be heated but we didn't need to pay as the hot tub spilling into the pool made the temperature perfectly pleasant. The rooms were all great (especially the master bedroom and en suite - one word, wow!)We didn't spend any time around the clubhouse or shared pool but did have a look and it all seemed very nice. We instead made the most of our private pool spending quality family time together (or playing cards if raining) if we were not out at Disney etc.As with most rented places there could have been more in the way of kitchen accessories, spare light bulbs etc, and more sunbeds, but nevertheless thoroughly enjoyed our 3 week stay and will always have fond memories and would love to live there!",2015/09/09,2015/07/01,,,,,,0,0,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynda2009,141,6,woman,,13,107,49,Art and Architecture Lover,46,45,16,2,0,0,0,173,"Manchester, UK",2008/04/01, 12464 ,43,2019/01/02

Excellent service.The 2 lounge areas are great for relaxing and the sports and movie packs on the cable TV mean there is always something on if you want to relax with a bit of TV.The free WIFI is great and handled all 10 of us on our mobiles / tablets etc without a problem.Bedrooms all lovely and clean and beds very comfortable with nice bed linen and covers.Air Con works very well, and the pool, deck area is just fantastic and a massive selling point to this villa. Many nights spent relaxing there having a cold drink and some food after a hard day at the parks.The games room was a massive hit with the boys and they spent may hours in there on a night playing pool, air hockey and table football.I would have no hesitation in returning here or recommending it to others.Thanks GuysJohn McConkey UK",2015/08/22,2015/08/01,Traveled with family,2  ,,,,0,0,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheGasMan,58,4,,,35,20,94,Foodie,17,3,0,0,0,0,0,113,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",2005/03/01, 4454 ,30,2019/01/02

It is really close to Disney - Animal Kingdom is only 5 to 10 minutes drive maximum, even at busy times. We have stayed at this resort three times in different villas and are returning from the UK again next year and we always feel really safe and secure staying there. Most problems that other folk reviewing have raised seem to relate mainly to their having booked through various unsatisfactory owners/agents. We have always used Villa Direct, who let a large range of properties in this community. Their staff are really friendly and courteous and, most importantly, always resolve any problems quickly. We were once locked out of a property due to an electronic failure in the door locking mechanism late at night during a very heavy thunderstorm and their engineer was at the property in 20 minutes and sorted it straight away. Also, with this company, you get free international and local calls (great if you need to phone home) and free Wi-Fi.The properties have stayed in have all been well maintained and clean and linen, towels and cleaning are all included in the rental charge. The two properties we would recommend are Dutch Royal Treat and The Irish Jig (both in the quiet Comrow Street), which have their own pools and whirlpool tubs and a good outlook. These are north facing, which means you can be lovely and warm on a sunbed in the shaded lanai area without getting fried.Top tip - use Sherberth Road (off H192) for the quickest route into Disney.",2015/08/17,2015/06/01,Traveled with family,3  ,5,5,,0,0,,5,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappySmileyGirl,11,3,,,,15,10,,12,3,0,0,0,0,0,15,"Ware, United Kingdom",2015/02/01, 1520 ,14,2019/01/02

After arriving at Sanford airport, the Thomson Holiday rep, handed us an envelope with the details and instruction of where we were staying in Orlando and that we would need to register at Hotel Beds the following morning.The Windsor Hills is an impressive array of properties in a fantastic location if your intention is to visit Disney and Universal.It is a gated community, meaning that you have to check in with security at the gates who issue you with a barcode pass.The properties in the resort are a mixture of privately owned or managed by property management companies.The villa we had booked with Thomson Holidays is a 6 bedded Orlando Plus Villa.On arrival we noticed that there was no hot water in the villa, along with13 other issues which ranged from the A/C in the games room not working, to no provision of oven trays, etc. to be able to use the oven, the number of sun loungers, 2 in a six bed villa, to the state of the crockery, cutlery, pots and pans, pool lights, microwave not working, oh!!! and an infestation of cockroaches, to name but a few.Did we mention that this was a self catering holiday, without the use of an oven or a microwave, not sure that the Windsor Hills will allow us to build a camp fire to cook food on?We are now well within our second week and trying as hard as we can to get Thomson Holidays Florida resort, customer services and their 24/7 holidayline, to pull their finger out and actually do something constructive. Instead they just forward our emails and phone calls etc, to Hotel Beds who in turn forward these to the property management company (A certain catchphrase of the Chuckle Brothers comes to mind).In fairness, since we notified Thomson Holidays of these issues, it only took 2 days for the hot water issue to be resolved, which the property maintenance man had to drill through a locked cupboard in the garage/games room before he was able to turn up the hot water controls, which begs us to question how the cleaners managed to clean the property without hot water??All other issues took about a week to resolve, apart from the replacement microwave and fumigation of the family of cockroaches who we are currently sharing our villa with. These were expected to be resolved today, Monday 22nd June, but we are not confident they will be.We also requested a transfer of villa on several occasions, given the no. of issues we have reported since arrival but Thomson Holidays chose to ignore our requests, in fact they haven't really been in touch with us, apart from an occasional reply to our emails, in which their response is, they are doing everything they can to resolve these issues...... And will forward these details on!!For us, the customer/family who are supposed to be enjoying our holiday and relaxing....... this is definitely not the case.It is also unfair for us to bemoan the Windsor Hills resort for the actions or not of Thomson Holidays, as we are extremely impressed by the location, cleanliness and security of the place. It is just unfortunate that Thomson Holidays don't seem to care what happens to their customers once they have their money.Thank you Thomson Holidays....

Loved having the washer/dryer, came home with all clean clothes! Loved having a kitchen with lots of pots and pans for cooking, we for sure took advantage of that!! We were in the pool Everyday during our visit, and sometimes even late at nights! We did visit the community pool area with the water slide 3 times during our visit. (it was just a short walk from our unit). We even ordered some foods from the store area they have. I highly recommend eating at their food area! The foods were GREAT! My daughter Loved the Water Slide!! We loved that the resort was gated with security! Honestly I could go on and on about this resort, it was amazing! Honestly my husband and I are considering looking at buying a town house in this resort in the future. Until we do this will for sure be our #1 top place to stay when going to the Disney area! (Which your only like 1.5 mile from the entrance to the Disney Gates).

It was perfect for our large family!Windsor Hills is VERY convenient to the Disney entrance (about 2 miles) and there is a large Target, several supermarkets and many restaurant choices all very close by. I have read some reviews that complain about the rules at the resort. True, you have to pass a guard house to enter the resort and cars are not allowed to block sidewalks, but the few rules keep the resort safe and looking nice. Garbage pick-up was daily (except Wed) and all personnel were very friendly and helpful. If you have rented a vacation home in the past, you know homes can differ greatly, even in the same resort. This may account for the varied reviews. Our rental home was kept up in every way. The home was fully stocked with everything you would need in a kitchen and all the towels and linens were provided. The air conditioning, pool heater, WIFI, washer/dryer, mattresses, etc were fine. And there was plenty of hot water for our large fam to take showers!

This most recent Villa on Comrose St. was called the ""Irish Jig"" and it was quite disappointing. We were guests of the renters. For the uninitiated, the villas are actual houses, some larger than others, but they all have virtually identical private pools. First off, you pay extra if you want the pool heated, and it takes a day or two for it to fully heat up, but the property management won't turn it on in advance, so right off the bat you lose a day or two to a cold pool. Ours was 71F and took two days to get up to 85F, and this was after calling maintenance. Then the hot tub didn't bubble or heat up much above 90F. On our last full day, they came again and found that the filter needed changing, and that was causing flow problems, but too little too late for our visit. Here's a list of some of the other oddities and shortcomings:The dishwasher was broken, missing the little roller wheels to help guide the lower rack in and out, and it wouldn't preheat the water so it wouldn't wash very well unless you ran the hot water in the sink for awhile just before turning it on. The fridge ice maker would clunk horribly all night, so we simply turned the switch off, which then produced a flood overnight all over the floor, nearly causing one of us to fall over backwards in the early morning and break a neck. There were no towel racks in the bathrooms. The lighting was horrible throughout the house. The pool light worked but the hot tub light did not. The decor and furnushings were extremely dated. All TV's were the old CRT style, and there was even a VCR. The remote for the TV didn't work unless you squeezed the life out of it. All the batteries in all the clocks throughout the house were dead (we went to Publix and bought new batteries). One clock on the wall was missing all the numbers except the 12 and the 5.The sink was missing the stopper, so you couldn't fill the sink and wash dishes by hand. We contacted the property management about the maintenance issues and they quickly sent someone over, but none of the issues were properly resolved before we left. We asked for a discount but we're told ""no, we solved all your problems"". We've had good luck with other units, but not this one.

We usually opt for hotels. I was pleasantly surprised about the amount of space in the townhome that we rented. It was only a few minutes walk to the pool area. We fully enjoyed the heated pool and the hot tub. It's a nice combination to have the surplus of space (3 bedrooms plus 3 full bathrooms) and a resort style pool. We prefer to enjoy a bit of social life at the common area pool vs. spending time in the townhome's private pool. We have 2 boys, ages 17 and 12 that participated in the games at the pool plus the occasional ride on the waterslide. The staff was very friendly. Comforting to know that if we had forgotten to bring any necessities, I could probably purchase something from the store/snack bar to tide us over for the week. Super handy to have in-suite laundry, I really missed that when we continued in our travels, staying at hotels with no laundry facilities.

It is on a first floor and is handy to the parking area. The furnishings are very tasteful and the beds very comfy.When we arrived the condo was sparkling clean and well equipped.From our unit to the pool is a short 2 block walk and to the tennis courts, sand volleyball, picnic, and putting greens in the common area is also very close. (They just resurfaced the tennis courts and they are very nice!) The children's playground is a little further - kind of in the middle of the Resort property. Each condo has a laundry built in. There is no maid service, so long term stays (we are here for 2 months) require you launder your own bed and bath linen.The workout center is small but well equipped. We found that waiting until just after lunch yields the best access. A small convenience store has many of the things you may have forgotten, but we are only 1 mile south of US192 (Irlo Bronson Highway), so many stores and restaurants are readily available.Access to the property is controlled using a modern bar code system so no one can sneak in. The main gate is manned by guards 24X7. Location is great - very close to Disney and Old Towne Kissimmee as well as I-4 for a quick run to Winter Haven, Lakeland or even Tampa.We've been informed by or owner that she is selling the condo, so not sure if we'll be back next year.

I'm very disappointed with the service we received especially for paying prime dollar during the holiday season. We arrived and the condo smelled very musty due to air being set so high and no air circulation. It took two days and a bottle of febreeze to get the smell to a point to where I could handle it (still washing clothes over and over at home to get smell out of them). The condo was not overly clean...found a used maxi pad in washer stuck to the side and washer was disgustingly dirty with scum around the top of drum. Dryer took 1 1/2 hours or more to dry a small load of towels. Bathrooms had mold in showers and black stuff (assume mold in toilets). We had a loose door handle on lanai that my husband tightened but the knob feel totally off after a couple days. I called the number provided at 9:14 AM and no one called back by closing time so we were forced to go buy and install a new door handle if we wanted a locked door while we slept. That's exactly what we did (our expense) and NEVER received a return call the whole time we were there! Not only did we pay over 1700.00 dollars to rent the condo we also paid for a new door handle, time to install, cleaning supplies and time to clean the condo to our comfort. They say the condos are professionally cleaned...I suggest they do some checking on the job done. I hire a housekeeper back home and never would I find my home this dirty and gross!We also had a cockroach in our kitchen...I mentioned this when I called about broken door handle but again heard nothing. I know this is common for the area and was thankful we never seen another one. This was my second time staying in a condo at Windsor Hills; however I will not be returning!

We were excited to be placed in a 3 bedroom townhome vs. a condo, though either would have been fine with us. There is no doubt that the amount of space was great - living room, full bath and bedroom on the first floor, two full beds and baths on the second floor. The townhome was definitely dated, but given that we were there for the theme parks that didn't bother me much - though it did feel a little dirty. To give an idea, there were only VCR's available in the townhome. The major issue has been the administration and their responses (or lack thereof) - before our arrival we had asked for a pack and play and were told there was a $40 charge. We brought our own (what a pain to fly with) and when we arrived there was one available in the pantry closet. After we left, we realized we had left our baby monitor camera in one of the rooms. I called and emailed and was told they were very busy but would get back to me. I didn't hear anything regardless of how many calls I made, but received an email 6 weeks later saying I was being charged $53 for a broken soap dispenser in a bathroom we hadn't used. I responded to the email explaining that we hadn't used that bathroom, and more importantly, I'd like a response on the baby monitor camera (which was $50). She said she would forward the response to management. I followed up and was once again told they were very busy and she would send a reminder. Nothing as of today.Unfortunately, my ""deal"" ended up costing me $150 more than I had planned. I stayed at the resort nearly 3 months ago, and I feel that I gave them a very fair amount of time to at a minimum respond, but hopefully rectify this issue. Given that I still have not heard back I think it's fair to share this experience with others.

We have explored and stayed in other Kissimmee/Disney areas, but we have not found one that combines proximity to the parks, amenities at a community and value for price paid better than what we have at Windsor Hills.This property was no different, in fact, we far preferred staying here to being in a condo because of the space and location of the home. The noticeable differences between this and the condos are that this has en-suite bathrooms with every bedroom, a larger kitchen area, a private pool and a great open-concept first floor with eating and living areas.The owners were extremely responsive and always were in e-mail communication quickly with any questions we had during the reservation or pre-arrival process. Everything was taken care of swiftly, leading to an easy beginning of our stay.As for the value, I can't imagine getting a better price for what you are receiving. The townhome has large bedrooms and bathrooms, as well as common living space, and it is very clean and very comfortable. There is nothing over-the-top about the amenities, but it has everything you'll be looking for in a rental property.One of the big reasons we like Windsor Hills is the great community pool and clubhouse area. It is heated during the winter months and perfect for families of all ages. It's nice to have a private pool, although we opted not to use it, but the community pool is a two-minute walk from this property and a great location.

There is a small onsite ahop also serving snacks near the pool but plenty of restaurants and shops a short drive away. We have stayed at Reunion twice before and thought we'd try WH for a change.

We were three couples and having three double bedrooms of similar size was great. The house layout was really good with no wasted space. It was spotlessly clean and we only saw one cockroach in the entire stay. The television was massive and televisions in all bedrooms. Garage converted to a games rooms which was a real bonus. Also a bonus was the excellent wifi. I really cannot praise this house enough and as this was our 8th visit and stay in a house, we have sufficient experience to compare. The owner was incredibly helpful prior to departure and during the stay. He provides a great service and deserves to have his home rented out all of the time.I highly recommend this property.The resort:We have preciously stayed a couple of time in Davenport, three times in Formosa Gardens and once in Oak Island Cove. This is far and away the safest resort with great security. The biggest difference between this and Formosa Garden is the extra security but also the houses are tighter packed with less ground. To be honest this didn't bother us. The location is great, just a couple of minutes drive and you're into Disney World. Shops and restaurants near by and we also found using taxis on an evening really convenient. The main pool are was closed for refurb which is a shame, but didn't impact us too much.

Week 2 was better, but still new things went wrong...in general, the villa we were allocated has been neglected and unloved and is in need of some tlc.On arrivalThe villa allocation was wrong and security said that hotel beds had double booked so we'd have to find alternative accommodation (we found this out after going to the allocated villa but two cars were on the drive). The 'welcome centre' on site at Windsor hills were less than welcoming but eventually called hotel beds who said they gave virgin the wrong number.After calming down our 8 yr old who was crying and convinced we'd need to find an alternative, we eventually found the right villa.Once in, we were disappointed- Bed mattress v old and sunken - did not make us feel comfortable as we were sleeping on several years of visitors' use - we switched rooms after the virgin/hotel beds inspection on day two as there was no option to switch villa.- Smoke alarm battery needed replacing and through the constant beeping it kept us awake first night - when we complained to hotel beds on registration the morning after arrival, this and other issues were dismissed as 'they don't have time to do a detailed inspection before every new occupancy' - we were not impressed - they only relented to some action when I threatened to reject the holiday in its entirety and put this in the hands of our lawyer - they agreed to do a joint inspection with the Virgin rep. However this inspection was clearly just an attempt to put sticking plasters over the issues and actually cost us another &gt;$1000 in theme park tickets that the virgin rep sold us in what I now term as a hard sell as she did this while saying that she would see what colleagues would be able to do as compensation - which gave us the impression that all these tickets might be reimbursed - not the case, we ended up accepting a cheque for a few hundred pounds so that we could at least try to enjoy week two - the offer of a cheque took over a week to come and we were sick of the hassle. Frankly this was about poor service and not money as we had paid over £8,000 for the holiday with Virgin. The rep initially tried to dismiss our concerns by saying the bulk of our holiday cost was flights, but we bought it as a package - otherwise what's the point of a package holiday!- Dirty plates, cups and cutlery- almost everything needed re-washing.- No garage - owners turned this into a poorly maintained games room (air hockey barely worked and pool table had no markings left so was in need of re-felting).- Shower heads were very dirty (orange and green scum around the nozzles) as was the fridge ice/water dispenser - the virgin/hotel beds inspection on day two resulted in replacement shower head inserts and a simple clean of the fridge dispenser - but the water dispenser still wouldn't work.- No safe in the villa so you need to be trusting or find other arrangements.- V old cheap TFT TVs in all but main lounge - all working but in need of investment in decent technology.- House appeared smaller than on photos - although was 5 bed, 3 were on ground floor.- rear doors onto pool area did not lock, it was clearly damaged previously which didn't inspire confidence - the virgin/hotel beds inspection on day two resulted in a bodge job to make the lock work although this only worked when the whole frame of the door is lifted into level position. They also said they would fit plastic retainer locks which they did two days later and only after complaining a second time, but they dropped off the night that they were fitted and wouldn't stay on - poor.Good pointsNice big house on the inside.Great pool - kids loved that.Location - 15 mins to Disney and 20 to Universal.General estate is very well maintained.Themed rooms in two of the rooms (boys sports and a princess room - although all this was light touch and felt like it was done on the cheap).Clean generally - as in there weren't dirty marks everywhere and the sheets/towels were clean.Great fridge and cooker - typical US super-sized ones.I definitely wouldn't recommend this estate unless you know exactly which villa you're getting!!",2014/06/06,2014/05/01,,8  ,,,,0,0,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrWolfy,60,6,,,9,126,115,,53,43,14,9,7,0,0,136,"Elsworth, United Kingdom",2010/04/01, 13115 ,53,2019/01/02

Being close to the pool was key as I was with my 9 yr old, and we spent a lot of time around the pool. The pool is large, although it gets crowded at times. They have a twisting slide that the kids (and myself) had a lot of fun using. My only complaint was the pool was WAY too warm...maybe upper 80s? It barely cooled you off. There are tons of food choices near by, and the drive into the parks was easy 15-20 minutes. I would definitely consider staying here again.

Check-in was pretty painless, but timing is probably everything - if you arrive right at 4pm (our checkin time) on a Friday, you might have a long line. You'll need the printout to be able to checkin and we told the guard and was able to get my parents in who came later. They'll give you a pass and you'll need that to get in AS WELL as to get out, which requires holding it up against the sensor for a few seconds, which was a little annoying.The room itself was independently owned/designed, so the décor and furniture and accessories (towels, TVs, dishes, etc) is probably going to vary considerably - its not like the Celebration resort where everything is professionally designed. Our place was very dated in design (80's mirror decorations), but was very clean and very well taken care of. I suppose there is a risk that you might get a place that's poorly taken care of, so keep that in mind. The walls itself showed age with the patterned walls (kinda like popcorn ceiling for walls) which wasn't bad, but certainly wouldn't be seen in a luxury condo or resort. Having the small wading pool was actually pretty nice. Deep enough to play in and have a nice break. The (required by FL law) door alert thing was very annoying. You had to push a button everytime you opened the door and again if it stayed open for more than about 30 seconds.The resort pool was nice. We had to drive to it, which was a minor minus, but it was clean and large. There were a ton of people (probably 60-70 in the pool itself), but it wasn't stressful and there were only about 6-7 kids waiting in line for the slide.In terms of location, its about as close as you can get outside of Disney property... but does that really matter? If you check Google Maps, it'll show a 10-13 minute drive to Epcot and that's about right. It'll then take you 15+ minutes to park and take a shuttle, etc so it's not like you can just walk out of the park and be back. It'll be a 30+ minute process at least and probably longer for Magic Kingdom with the monorail/boat step as well. I'm not saying that distance doesn't matter, because you SURE don't want to be stuck in Orlando commuter traffic while trying to get to Disney when it opens, but don't get caught up in whether its 1 mile or 2 miles or even 5 miles away. The local Publix wasn't too crowded or stressful, which is a very nice positive change compared to our previous stay (Blue Heron) where it was an absolute madhouse trying to get groceries.Will we stay here again? Probably, although I didn't feel like this resort was ""it"". It didn't have that overwhelming niceness like Celebration did, but certainly had it where it counted.",2014/04/07,2014/04/01,Traveled with family,1  ,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirkH670,10,3,,,,16,27,,8,5,1,1,1,0,0,16,"Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States",2012/03/01, 1627 ,20,2019/01/02

Gated, with a convenience store and a big pool with water slide, the resort was only 8 minutes drive from Animal Kingdom park, and about 10-15 mins from the others.We felt it was very reasonably priced at about $100 a night, much less than we would have paid for one room at an in-park resort.Would definitely stay here again and recommend it to other families",2014/01/22,2013/06/01,Traveled with family,4  ,3,3,4,0,0,5,4,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saskiwi,130,5,woman,35-49,,55,62,,15,35,3,3,0,0,0,176,Christchurch,2005/10/01, 7982 ,25,2019/01/02

Jardines preciosos, entras con palmeras a los lados y llegas a la garita donde estan los guardas de seguridad para pedirte identificacion. Luego que haces el check in desde tu auto te dan la llave de acceso para que pases por la aguja . Llegas a la casa club donde tienen una piscina climatizada, gimnasio y un supermercado. Sigues hacia tu town house o tu condo (los town houses tienen piscina privada) pero todos tienen las mismas condiciones. Eramos mis 2 hijos menores de 6 años y mi esposo y tomamos un condo con 3 habitaciones, totalmente equipados con las habitaciones decoradas con temas disney, cada cuarto con su baño, cocina, comedor, sala, lavadora, secadora todo esto sino mal recuerdo por $550 la semana. Para la segunda semana queriamos ir a un hotel para variar y nos fuimos a Double Tree by Hilton at sea world, y la verdad me decepcione cuando llegamos porque era un solo cuarto para los 4!! pero bueno, teniamos que seguir disfrutando y tratar de estar lo menos posible en el hotel asi que les vuelvo a reiterar que no hay nada mejor que este precioso lugar rodeado de bellos jardines y sobre todo tranquilidad.

It was not, after walking in the town home with private pool realized I had made a mistake. The home looked JUST like the pictures however when you looked a bit closer, there were bugs in the kitchen...everytime the dishwasher was open tonz of bugs ran from the inside, including the kitchen sink, counter..they went everywhere in the kitchen! The rug looked like it was never cleaned, including the living room furniture, which I put sheets over so we could sit on them (the sheets were grey they were so old). The first morning we tried to go in the pool, there was a dead frog floating around and so much scum on the sides it looked like it hasn't been cleaned in months! When I called the 'Magical Vacations' line I was told I get what I pay for, that I had a full-town house and things were differant in Florida than Canada and that I could not be moved as it wasnt a hotel. Then the man on the phone scolled me saying he had jeu spent an hour of his day on the phone with me because of a frog in the pool...this was not the case, its because it WAS NOT CLEAN, the house or the pool! The main floor had mostly tile but the one-bedroom did not, the space in-between was bug, with frayed carpet and nails sticking outward which I stepped on and was bleeding...My goodness, I can not believe I had taken my daughter &amp; mom to such a dirty place. After returning from a busy day, we walked into cock-roches in the front area by our shoes....I called and asked to be moved, I was told I can not be moved but they will bring in someone to spray the next business day, then was told ""you are the woman I spend an hour with on the phone because of a frog in the pool"", we were on the phone because the pool &amp; home was dirty and never did get cleaned! I left to another resort the next day and was reimbursed for the days I did not stay however this was state policy. There are many other wonderful vacation homes, with very reasonable prices out their, please be aware, it does look just like the photos but my goodness I do not recommend this at all and wouldn't want anyone else to have that experience.",2013/11/21,2013/11/01,Traveled with family,7  ,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tina20071107,1,,woman,,,1,7,,,,,,,0,0,1,"Fort McMurray, Canada",2013/10/01, 107 ,7,2019/01/02

In the end, we were happy to be a little farther from the busier townhouse area which had a lot of traffic coming and going.The clubhouse was nice and having a convenience store on site was useful for odds and ends. We didn't use the theatre or gym but thought it was great to have as an option.This resort is very safe,people were friendly and it is located close to everything if you have a car. We even drove to Tampa twice since it was only an hour away.The only negative was that the homes next door on both sides were 'owned&amp; managed' by a company, which meant they were booked continuously..3 days at a time. Meaning: every 3 days we'd have new neighbors who were thrilled to discover their private pool,would party the first evening loudly...then leave early loudly for Disney, come home late after Disney, hit the pool and recount their adventures...then repeat the same scenario the next day..finishing their last night with a party before leaving loudly for the airport the following morning. This repeated on both sides every 3days. We even had partying neighbors park on our lawn one night, which was dealt with quickly by Windsor Hills. They have a 0 tolerance policy and the local Sheriff will show up if called.We didn't call, but it was nice to know that there are rules that can/will be enforced if needed.In the end, we knew everyone was just happy to be on vacation...so we tolerated the noise.I could see this resort being a literal paradise during the slower vacation periods when the resort is less occupied. It is so well maintained,you are challenged to find any flaws.",2013/10/16,2012/11/01,,,5,5,5,0,0,5,,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bearsvacationing,11,3,,,8,18,13,Thrill Seeker,11,2,0,2,3,0,0,26,"Winnipeg, Canada",2012/07/01, 2053 ,21,2019/01/02

When we arrived at the home, there was no BBQ there. I contacted the owner about this and was told that it was old and gross and they decided to get rid of it. They had no plans to replace it. At the time of this review, it is still being advertised with pictures of it on the website for the home.One of the large reasons we booked the home was because it listed a PS2 and an Xbox360 on the website. When we arrived at the house we did see the two consoles, but there were no games for either of them. I asked the owner about this and was told that guests had removed them from the home and they had no plans to replace them. I was also told that I could rent games from the clubhouse but when we called the clubhouse, they informed us that they do not have games to rent. So basically we had unusable game consoles unless we wanted to go somewhere and shell out money to buy games for them. For both of these items I asked the owner for a partial refund. We thought it was only fair that we get some money back for a missing BBQ and no games for 2 game consoles. I was told by the owner that they were not going to give me a refund because of the following:#1. We did not pay extra for the BBQ so there was no reason we should have expected it. I explained to the owner that it was specifically listed in the quote she gave me for the house and she again told me that it was a free amenity so I was not to expect it at the home. I was also told that they removed any advertising of the BBQ some time ago. At the time of this review, you can go to their website and see several pictures with the BBQ in them.#2. The owner said they never advertised games for the PS2 and the Xbox360. That is true. However, if I rent a home with game consoles, I expect there to be games to play with them. They are of no use to anyone if they do not have games. When I asked the owner about them I was told that they were removed from prior guests and that was something she had no control over and that they did not intend on buying new ones. Maybe that is something I should not have expected, but we rented 3 other homes in Windsor Hills at the same time and all of them had games to go with the consoles.The house itself is beautifully decorated and the kitchen is well stocked. However, it was not as clean as I would have liked it to be. The management company only works on Mon-Fri and we checked in on a Saturday. So I had to wait until Monday to have someone come out and re-clean a few of the bathrooms.I wanted to write this review to inform people that there is no BBQ at the home and no games for the consoles in case they booked the home specifically for these items. I think it is only fair to let people know. Here are more details of the home and our experience.When I walked into the bathroom there was hair (pubic and regular) all over the floor and worse, all over the bathroom mats. I also found toenails both on the bathroom floor and in the rug in the bedroom. I brought this to the attention of the homeowner who basically told me I was a liar and that she had just been there and personally cleaned all these items herself. I know what pubic hair looks like and it was everywhere on those bathroom rugs. I ended up rolling them up and throwing them in the closet because there was no way that I was going to step on them, they were that gross. After the owner went on and on about how there was NO WAY that I was seeing all this stuff, she told me that she contacted the mgmt. company to contact me. The next day (Sun) someone came out to take a look at things. He agreed that the bathrooms were gross but paused when I mentioned the bug that were on the floor behind the couch. He asked me where they were and I told him that I already vacuumed them up because they were gross and I wanted them gone. So since they were not there when he came, I think he was not sure if he should believe me. He told me that the crew does not work on weekends and the earliest someone could come out was Monday, we checked in on a Saturday. So Monday this ONE guy comes in the house with a broom and sweeps the bathroom floor and spays some bleach solution in the shower and leaves. He was there not more than 20 minutes and was supposed to re-clean all 5 bathrooms. No way that happened, but I was so done with it at that point I was not going to argue my way through my vactation.When I got home and after I contaced the owner about a partial refund ($250) and she said no, I told her that was her perogative but that I would have to write a negative review based on my experience with her and her home. She then THREATENS me and said that if she finds any negative review from me or anyone associtated with me, that she would sue me.So I would stay FAR AWAY from this house and this owner.

There is a feeling of being secure within the complex, the staff on the entrance are friendly and efficient. Location wise, the complex is ideal for the Disney parks and about 20 minutes from Universal &amp; SeaWorld. There are plenty of places to eat within 5 minutes on the 192.The villa we had, had the garage converted into a play room with a pool table, football table, darts,basketball game and tv/video games along with the washer and drier, very warm in there, but the kids loved it. We only saw 3 cockroaches throughout our stay, so it may have something to do with the garage having been sealed when it was converted into the games room.All in all I would recommend Windsor Hills to anyone who does not want to be driving for ages to get to the parks, last year we stayed in a villa in Davenport, way too far out from anywhere!",2012/11/05,2012/10/01,Traveled with family,2  ,4,,4,0,0,4,4,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephenj384,140,6,man,,,184,129,,27,114,36,5,2,0,0,185,"Doncaster, United Kingdom",2012/03/01, 18599 ,47,2019/01/02

The main pool gets very busy at the resort so I would suggest you use your own pool and pay for it to be heated, we made the mistake of NOT having it and boy did we regret it.

The location of the villa was great, although not sure how guests without care hire would feel, but we had cars and found we were not far from the Disney parks or I4 which leads to Universal. The villa had all amenities and enough kitchenware to host a full scale party!! the only thing I hated was the Cockroaches in the garage at night, so we had a rule that the door into the house from the garage remained closed and locked at night. the beds were lovely and comfortable, although air conditioning did not appear to work that well in our bedroom on the ground floor. all rooms were ensuite with good closet space and most had walk in Wardrobes and a private area to dress. It is the first time I have stayed in a villa, but due to there being 9 in our group, it was by far the cheaper option, if like me you enjoy comfortable surroundings. I found the villa, comfortable, clean and if I was travelling in a large party again would definitely stay in a villa, and even though I would recommend Windsor Hills, would probably stay somewhere else, just because I don't like staying at the same place twice. externally I would agree with others, security is good and very friends but the amenities were poor (arcade, shop...), but there's a Target and Publix nearby...if you have a car!",2012/10/19,2012/09/01,Traveled with family,1  ,4,3,4,0,0,4,4,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bicardi65,75,4,woman,35-49,,31,25,,3,17,9,1,1,0,0,33,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",2008/07/01, 3325 ,21,2019/01/02

God help those who had booked bronze silver or gold!!! First impressions are ok though did look a bit dated. As the time progresses you notice marks on the walls, poor grouting in bathroom areas and actually quite a dirty property. Unfortunately our pool pump stopped working which also removed the water from the spa. Hotel beds advised us that Florida stores who manage the property would be contacted but as it was a Saturday would not be out until Monday (it was Tuesday) and heyho after a short spell of working on the Friday the pump went off again. Was advised that water was ok to swim in. No chance slimy film on the surface dead insects on top of the water and other items in the water. At the same time the temperature kept fluctuating and on the Staurday was at 89 degrees which indictaed a faulty air conditioning unit. Obviously this is a well maitained villa Hotel beds said someone would come straight away which to their credit was true though not after informing us that if it was a manual fault we would be charged. You cant move in the villa for signs and rules advising you that you will be charged for this that and the other. The location of Windsor Hills is excellent the property of 2686 is not. I remember reading a review on here relating to this villa and hoping i did not get allocated it. It would seem that Thomson's have not addressed some of the concerns previously identified and i have also sent a complaint in regarding the villa and await their reply",2012/09/09,2012/08/01,Traveled with family,9  ,1,3,1,0,0,2,1,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonyrosssafc,3,,,,,2,10,,,,,,,0,0,2,"Sunderland, United Kingdom",2010/08/01, 210 ,8,2019/01/02

It all started a few years ago, when we stayed in a condo on Almaton Loop for two weeks and fell in love with the resort, so bought a home and have been going there ever since!! It's a great resort!! It's extremely secure with Security check-in at the front gates so its safe to let kids roam free! Houses vary in size and in condition, so its best to check with individual villa rental companies to see what each house is like, don't judge too much on people's photos of homes because each home is completely different! There is a large communal pool area with a great buzz and a real tropical feel! There is also a small gym, a small ""cinema"" and you can request movie showings from a list in the welcome office. There are also playgrounds, two large tennis courts, a volleyball area, putting green and basketball courts. All have floodlights so you can play into the evening when the temperatures cool down! There is also a sundry shop that has all the little things you need and also serves pool snacks. This property is located approx. ten minutes from Disneyland, 20 minutes from SeaWorld, 20-25 to Florida Mall, 30 mins to Mall at Millenia and about an hour and a half to Cocoa Beach on the East Coast or St Pete's beach on the West (perhaps this sounds like a lot but with a Car on Florida's roads its a breeze!!) It's also about 5 minutes from some great restaurants, including Longhorn Steakhouse, Outback, Bahama Breeze, TGI Fridays to name but a few. Formosa Gardens is about five minutes away and has a large supermarket and liquor store, there is also a SuperTarget just a little bit past that on the US192 and WalMart isn't too much further away. You won't find a better location than this, trust me!! I recommend a home nearer the pools, Almaton Loop has some great condos, Comrow has some great large villas and there are some great town-houses off Teascone Boulevard!!",2012/09/08,2012/07/01,Traveled with family,3  ,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Time2Holiday,50,5,woman,25-34,71,29,22,,16,6,5,2,0,0,0,100,"Dublin, Ireland",2010/03/01, 5052 ,25,2019/01/02

Good location would return!,6jonesss,"Well like another reviewer we were also given 2686 manesty lane, was not impressed by this villa at all. 4 bedroom villa, the furniture all looked nice on 1st appearance but the more you look around the more you seen how dirty the villa actually was. It could really do with a lick of point and good clean. The pool is in the shade all day &amp; night. We were originally booked into Windsor palms but were apparently upgraded to here when we arrived, I rang to complain there was no games room and we paid for 1, I was told that we were upgraded to a better villa location, I told them to put me back were I should of been then &amp; in my executive villa with games room as I knew myself there was not much difference between the 2 villa complexes. Stayed in 7770 dec/jan 11/12. We booked this villa privately and this was a big 6 bedroom villa. The pool received the sun most of the day, the furniture the the villa was nice although some of the bar stools were broken, as was the Hoover. Games room was ok but really needs a good clean out. I don't blame the owners for this as they lived in England so obviously don't go and check this every few weeks, this is down to the management company and other visitors who probably don't respect it due to it not being there own belongings. I would return to Windsor hills as I felt safe, this year however were returning to emerald island again as it was alot cheaper.

When we landed at Orlando we arrived 20mins early so because we have been 10 times already we decided to make our way to the villa as no virgin rep was present.We got to Windsor Hills to be told that we had to o to Hotel beds to register after a long flight thats all you need. They were very quick in giving us all our info. We stayed in Manesty Lane not sure what no think it was 1723. We got in and thought wow this is amazing then on closer inspection we thought oh maybe not. The pool area had loads of toys bundled in the corner and a dirty towel on the floor not what you would expect from a 5star property. The rooms were clean and tidy the bathrooms were not there was mould in the shower in the en-suite which made me feel sick. There was no cleaning products or mops or brooms to keep it clean so after a couple of days I got out the hover it did not work. We wanted dinner so decided to eat in it took ages to work out how to work every kitchen appliance (instructions would be handy). On the 3rd day we decided to go to the communal pool lots of rowdy teenagers fighting in the pool so our kids wouldn't use the slide(we never went back to the pool after that) the problem was in our villa we only had 3 sun beds our villa is meant to sleep 12 people, the patio are had a broken chair which we reported but it was never replaced so if you are travelling with a lot don't expect to all sit outside as there is not enough seats or beds. Not that there is a lot of patio space anyway. Like I said before we have been a few times so we really wanted to sit and sunbath but we couldn't. The games room was good my son enjoyed playing pool but the darts didn't work and neither did the air hockey. Also the dinning area only had 6 seats round the table so we couldn't all sit and have dinner together. On the 4th day we decided that maybe the villa just was not for us so we emailed virgin to see if we could transfer to a hotel they said no(very rude and abrupt) they were so nice with 15 phone calls when I was booking disney tickets with them. So we bit the bullet and paid ourselves to stay for a few nights and disney swan and dolphin we had a great time and it was the only bit of sunbathing we did the kids played in the pool all day then we caught the boat to the parks from the hotel and made the most of the free transport offered by disney. Im trying not to be negative but it is tricky the villa overall was big and spacious but just a bit tired and grotty not worth the money at all our friends stayed 7 miles away and we went to their villa although it was the same standard it cost them a lot less £600 per week as they booked it independently. I think when we go next time I will book my own villa and try to find something of better quality. The shop on the complex stocks essentials only but we thought it was very expensive so we drove to wall mart which was much cheaper $1.00 for a dishwasher tablet is quite expensive. We love Orlando so we will stay at a villa again but not through virgin. Its nice having your own space in the mornings and evenings. I noticed in an earlier review they said the gate got quite busy at times they seem to of sorted that as a guard(who are all very friendly) stays there at busy times now so its no problem.",2012/08/11,2012/07/01,Traveled with family,4  ,3,3,1,0,0,3,3,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionagooderson,5,1,woman,35-49,,4,12,,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,"Sittingbourne, United Kingdom",2010/08/01, 417 ,11,2019/01/02

The villa was excellent and had everything we needed. The kids really enjoyed the pool at the villa, but also enjoyed the lagoon pool at the clubhouse which they could walk to themselves. Windsor hills is a gated estate and our kids aged 13 and 11 could go to the playpark or games room themselves. There is a small shop selling a good range of essentials - the prices were very reasonable. They also sell sandwiches ($3.50), draft beer ($11 for a large pitcher), chicken nuggets&amp;fries ($5) which we found great for the afternoons at the pool because we didn't have to go back to the villa when the kids got hungry.Our friends rented a 2 bed condo at the same time and they loved it too.There are lots of great restaurants 5-10 mins drive away (Black Angus, Olive Garden, Texas Road House, Angels, Longhorns and our favourite orlando restaurant - Wildside). There is a Publix Supermarket about 10mins drive, a Walmart about 7 mins drive, a huge Walmart about 15mins away and a Wallgreens about 5 mins away.Windsor Hills is really close to Disney, but a little further to Universal Studios and Seaworld.

When we arrived at the airport we collected our documenation and was advised that we had been allocated 2686 Manesty Lane. On our way to the villa we called at Hotelbeds and completed the necessary registration. You have to leave a $500 security depoist (on cc) or you can pay $39 'insurance waiver'. We left ours via the cc.As I know the area reasonably well we set off and were soon outside of our villa. We were all excited, especially my son's GF who had never been to Florida before. When we opened the door we were greeted by that 'musty' smell you get when a property hasn't been used in a while. Once we were into the property and opened the blinds I felt an immediate sense of disappointment. No way was this a Platinum property! If it was, heaven help the people who book, gold, silver or bronze properties.There were scrape marks all over the walls. The doors, door frames, skirting boards, were scrapped, dented and chipped. One of the bedrooms had pencil scribble on the wall. I went to open the patio door to look outside and the patio door tracks were filthy! Not dirty, filthy! The breakfast table was all marked and chipped. In fact the whole place felt shabby. To say we were disappointed was an understatement. I called Hotelbeds as you have to inform them of any damage with 24 hours. 'Sorry about that, we'll report those matters'. That was it. Well we decied we would make the best of it as we were at least in sunny Florida. We had arranged to be at MK for rope drop next day so I decided I would call in at Hotelbeds the next day to discuss matters further. We unpacked and went straight out to get something to eat, intending to return and have an early night. Unfortunately when we got back to the villa we found that the sockets in the kitchen weren't working. Hubby checked the fuseboard and said it appeared OK so we had no idea what the problem was, but it was something else to tell Hotelbeds. We also had to go and buy coat hangers as there were only about 10 between the whole four bedrooms! However these are only about $3 for 18 at Walmart, so not to much of a problem.When we got to the HB office and explained about the 'shabby' villa the agent just shrugged his shoulders and said I would need to take the matter up with Thomsons. Regarding the electricity he rang the Florida Store who are the property management company. They gave advice on how to reset the electricity and I wondered if it was such a common occurrence why they didin't have something about it in the villa. Apparantly there is a reset button in the middle of the socket. Being from the UK I had never encountered this before. I also asked about the safe but was told that I would have to wait until Monday to speak to the management company about it. I decided to have a look in the cupboards to see what there was in the way of cookware and found two pans that were absolutely disgusting. Rusted and dirty, they were only fit for the bin. Fortunately I wasn't planning on doing much more than making breakfast.On our fourth day I decided I would change the beds. Guess what, there was no change of bedding for either of the king beds. I phoned the management company and they insisted that the bedding was there so I said in which case could they come and find it. They also insisted that the property had only one king bed and two queens. Since I was standing looking at the beds I think I would know what I was looking at. They said they would send some bedding. When it didn't arrive in a couple of days, I emailed and asked them about it again. A lady appeared a couple of hours later and said it would be in the closet. 'Feel free to look' I said. Well when she couldn't find any she said she would drop some off later in the day. I did clearly explain that they were TWO king beds that I needed bedding for. While we were out one set of king bedding and one set of queen bedding was deleivered. I emailed the office again but by this time I was so sick that I just changed our bed, washed what I took off, dried it and put it on the other king. I should also mention that the sheets were the poorest quality bedding I have ever had in Florida, whether it be in a private rental or hotel.All in all I have to say that we had a lovely holiday, but the problems with the villa should not have happened. I saw the Thomson rep at the airport as we were leaving for home and I told her of my disappointment but she just said 'You will have to write to Thomsons'. I emailed Thomsons while we were in Florida and I followed that up with a letter when I got home (mid May). Thomsons have not even given me the curtesy of a reply. I am writing this review purely to warn future travellers what to expect.I hope that you will be able to see from the photos (if I manage to upload them) the kind of 'shabbiness' I refer to.

It was large and clean, with a full kitchen and laundry area. It was like home from home, cheaper than a 4star hotel and with a nice lounge to relax in. The childs room was disney themed, with plenty of cuddly toys and mickey wall paper. The resort is only 2miles to Disney. There are restaurants (McDonalds, Pondarossa, TGIs, Outback) just outside the complex on 192, and we drove to Walmart on sr27 around 5miles away.The complex pool is lovely for kids, zero entry with a water slide.The only thing for improvement could be a on site bar area/clubhouse type room, which serves food.Would recommend this resort to anyone staying in the Orlando area, especially families where you need more room than a standard hotel room, and for a lower cost per night.",2012/05/08,2011/06/01,Traveled with family,2  ,,,,0,0,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Martyn77,128,6,man,,19,105,58,Family Vacationer,18,58,27,0,2,0,0,124,"Exeter, United Kingdom",2010/07/01, 11133 ,39,2019/01/02

My Sons Injury Equated to the cist of a damaged Pool Net",LovesFloridaFam,"We have stayed at Windsor Hills 3 times now and let me say first our first two stays in the town homes were PERFECT. The same unfortunately can not be said of our most recent at vacationmoms 2518 Renshaw. The pool was filthy (see pictures) and freezing. Apparently the pool heater was ""off"" and the owner believes we turned it off rather than the possibility that it may have been mistakenly not turned on. The stairs to the upstairs bedrooms had a shotty repair with a nail sticking up in the middle. (see pics) Upon notifying owner the repairman thought it logical to fix it by adding 5 more nails which kept popping out as we used the stairs ... End result a nail through the foot of my special needs son the night before our 4 am flight home. Understand that the homeowner was made aware off all things in shotty order in her home. Drawers (false covers) that were off or about to fall off upon our arrival and a ripped pool net along with the concerns of the pool and the stair. One month after being home the home owners resolution to our compromised stay was to accuse us of breaking the net and smoking in her home and she was willing to return my damage deposit with $60 to cover the 3 days of no pool heat provided this was the end of it.When I clarified that she was really suggesting that my sons injury (actually he stepped on the nail twice but the first one just scratched the side of his foot) was worth a damaged pool net (which FYI we did not damage) and her allegation that there were cigarette buts found in here home and the home smelled like smoke implying we smoked in the home (which WE DID NOT ... My husband smoked a cigarillo each night on the front driveway) I was appalled. My suggestion was to reimburse 1/2 our rental since medical expenses were covered by Canadian taxpayers since we came home within hours of the injury I had it checked here in Canada. She stated that if I didn't take the deal she would be keeping my damage deposit. I replied she could keep that and anticipate a cost more in line with what it would cost a nonresident to receive the medical attention our son received in Canada. FYI We were also charged an additional $10 per night for a second child to stay with us. We had 2 adults and 2 children in a 3 bedroom home with a capacity of 8-9. This made no sense to me as an entire bedroom remained empty but we paid it willingly. Please don't let this keep you away from Windsor Hills as it is an incredible gated community that we will return to. Just remember that homes are privately owned and experience can vary greatly depending on that.
